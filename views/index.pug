            | Here you will find many of the web projects I&apos;ve developed since I began web development. Proficient in languages including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and many of JavaScript&apos;s popular libraries such as jQuery and AngularJS, I have used many techniques to build what you see here. There&apos;s plenty to explore and see, and plenty more on its way in the future, so feel free to check out my work and explore everything I have to offer. For those looking for a bit of history, I have been learning and practicing software development since the end of 2013. My main area of expertise is front-end web development, but I also know the basics of languages like Ruby, Python, and Java, as well as web frameworks combining these languages with front-end development.

                | Once upon a time, I took a trip to Southern Oregon, where he visited the cities in the area, including Ashland. It was a nice trip, and although it was smoky and hazy by the time I got to Ashland, I managed to get a fascinating sun-smoked image of the Elizabethan Stage at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. It inspired me to make a little web application about why you should visit Ashland
