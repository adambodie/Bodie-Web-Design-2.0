          h2 About Me
          h4 Who is Adam Bodie?
          p
            | I am a person who is reliable, devoted and always willing to do what needs to be done. Whether it&apos;s work or play, I strive to make sure things are done right and exact. With me, I am the whole package. Someone who&apos;s loyal to the team, incredibly focused on details, and passionate about what I do. There&apos;s nothing that passes me by.
          p
            | As you can see in my various projects, I have a knack for creativity and flair. It&apos;s just who I am. I love what I do and I love what I am. Take for example, my love of photography. Since I was young, I&apos;ve always been creative and artistic. Currently, my passion is photography, and with my love for developing, I am able to combine these two loves at ease. You&apos;ll see that through my works, and that&apos;s what I am about.
          p
            | My main passion for programming is front-end development, but I consider myself versatile in many ways. I&apos;m familiar with web frameworks like the popular Ruby on Rails, and Django. It&apos;s important to have one place to combine front-end client-side pages with back-end server side development. It&apos;s the virtual world we live in, where everything comes together to make one cohesive product. But like technology in general, it&apos;s a living creature, always evolving to bigger and greater things. Because of this, it&apos;s important to learn and keep learning. Ever since I was young, I&apos;ve always had a passion for learning, not only the basics, but to become &quot;the expert of things.&quot; Learning things is a passion to me, and an enjoyment in my life. It&apos;s what makes me the person I am. Even though I know some languages and features, I will never stop learning and never stop believing in myself.
          p
            | Truth is, I won&apos;t stop there. I love what I&apos;m doing. There are many more beasts to learn and develop with. Right now, my interest is with other JavaScript libraries I&apos;d love to learn, AJAX, Ember.js, React.js, you name it.
          p
            | Currently, I live in the Portland, Oregon area looking to begin my career in web development. But I&apos;m more than willing to relocate to work. If you&apos;re interesting in discussing opportunities with me or have any advice to give, I&apos;m more than willing to talk. Anywhere, anytime. That&apos;s always been my motto.

            p
              | Of course, like any business that&apos;s not open 24 hours, I am closed for business from time to time. Therefore, if you do send me an email after &quot;closing hours,&quot; please note that I am not likely to respond until I&apos;m ready to conduct business. Please keep that in mind when sending me an email. But I will respond, just give me time. Thank you and have a good day!

          p
            | These are programming skills that I have. I mostly prefer front-end development with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, but I have knowledge of other languages as well. The information provided showcases languages, libraries and other parts that I have worked with at some point. I&apos;m also skilled with programs like Microsoft Office and Adobe PhotoShop. In a sense, I am flexible and can easily adapt with computer software.
