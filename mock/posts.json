			"paragraph": "Growing up, I didn't think much of the Los Angeles Clippers.  Why should I have?  They were a complete joke, a bumbling group of losers who couldn't win squat, couldn't put together a decent roster and worst of all had an incompetent owner who wouldn't spend any money to keep what little talent they had.  It wasn't until the other owners handed them Chris Paul in an effort to keep him from being traded to the Laker did the Clippers finally start to look like a real basketball team.  But as the Lakers sunk to the floor, have the Clippers overtaken them? Not even close.  No matter how talented the Clippers are, they’ll always be in second place, and incapable of winning the title.  Whether they like it or not, they are defined by their disgraceful former owner Donald Sterling."
			}, {
		"paragraph": "The Clippers had an obvious crisis two years ago when Donald Sterling was recorded making numerous racist remarks about his fans, bringing the Clippers to national headlines, as people were disgusted with their idiotic owner and the players angry over the comments as well.  Even after kicking Sterling to the curb and being bought by Microsoft billionaire Steven Ballmer with his own money, the Clippers are still losers compared to the Lakers, even if they’re winning more than the Lakers.  They haven't completely shaken the bad aura of Donald Sterling, affecting their attitude and play in the process, often finding themselves on the wrong end of disappointment."
		}, {
		"paragraph": "The Clippers have never made it to the Western Conference finals, let alone the NBA finals in their history, from their foundings as the Buffalo Braves to their unnoticeable years as the San Diego Clippers and of course, as the ‘Donald Sterling joined L.A. because he couldn’t beat the Lakers, so he joined them‘ Los Angeles Clippers. They had a chance last year but blew a 3-1 lead against Houston.  Typical Clippers blunders, one joke after another, and had home court advantage to boot after 4 games.  This despite having a talented roster led by Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, who rank as two of the most talented players in the NBA.  And this year, with a possible chance to play Golden State without Steph Curry, they manage to lose both Blake Griffin and Chris Paul for the season in the same game. Beating Portland just became a lot tougher, if they can even do that at all.  But one has to wonder how the Clippers keep messing things up?"},{
	"paragraph": "They have a great coach in Doc Rivers; the only coach with NBA title winning pedigree, maturity and understanding of the Donald Sterling mess, really the only coach capable of bringing the team together and sympathizing with their plight as well.  Chris Paul is an elite point guard, great leader and the heart and soul of the team.  You’d think those two would bring the character the Clippers need.  Instead, they have obnoxious, selfish players who gloat like Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.  Blake Griffin, the guy who broke his hand punching an assistant trainer in a stupid fight, costing him a month of action. DeAndre Jordan, who waffled between leaving for Dallas and staying with the Clippers, loving every minute of the attention he got via the so-called Emoji Wars.  Unfortunately, it's these two who carry the team's me-first Lob City gloating attitude that makes the Clippers the underachieving team they are."}, {
"paragraph": "The Lakers never acted like that during any of their prime years.  Yet the Clippers seem to casually stroll into games like it doesn't care, lacking the instinct to perform to its potential.  They wouldn't even be a playoff team without Chris Paul; he’s the only player with heart, which goes without saying.  Is it because of Donald Sterling’s past influence? The feeling they’ll never pass the Lakers in prestige?  Maybe their key players are immature cry baby's with questionable character flaws.  Whatever the case, it's apparent that while Steve Ballmer can throw a whole bunch of money to try to make the Clippers a serious team, they'll never get rid of the curse that is Donald Sterling. So while Laker fans are saddened by their team's recent struggles, it compares nothing to being the sad joke that is the Los Angeles Clippers."}

                "paragraph": "As we're weeks away from Oregon’s Primary election, May 17th, it has become clear that for the first time in ages, Oregonians everywhere will actually have a say for the primaries.  As one of the last states, the candidate has typically been decided before April, but this year we’re in a dead heat on both sides of the puzzle.  With Kentucky the only other state with their primary the same day, Oregon at last will get the attention it needs for determining each party's nominee for President."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Obviously, Oregon is a Liberal state; it's going to vote Democrat for the Presidential election no matter who wins the race.  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are the two choices to pick from.  Hillary Clinton stands out as a former Senator, First Lady and Secretary of State, yet her campaign isn't as strong as it should be, with issues of trustworthiness being a big concern.  Bernie Sanders, an Independent Senator from Vermont and admitted Socialist, has come seemingly out of nowhere to pick up support from the Progressives who hate the fact that the system is rigged to favor the millionaires and billionaires."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Yet there are conservatives in Oregon as well, and they have their candidates.  Donald Trump leads the way with his big mouth and frequent racist divisive comments, yet Republicans are trying anything they can to keep him out of office. Ted Cruz, the religious nutcase Senator from Texas who hates to compromise, shows no appreciation for non-conservative thoughts and seems to hate everyone that's not Christian is also in the running. John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio, hangs on by a thread, hoping for a contested convention as he’s only won his home state, despite being the most traditional candidate left and the most reasonable of the bunch."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "I can't say I'm excited about any of the candidates, but I know one thing I am determined to see: that neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz get elected as President.  Both of these men (if we can even call them men, they act like a bunch of babies) are ridiculously unqualified and share absolutely pathetic views on the world, not to mention their hate filled speech.  I'm not crazy about either Hillary or Bernie but either one would be an easy choice over those two dweebs. John Kasich is a decent man but is lucky to be where he is and lacks charisma to get people to vote for him.  With the Republicans being so angry, I would be shocked if they settled on Kasich since he’s actually willing to compromise to get things done, an apparent no-no with Republicans these days."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "As a native Oregonian, I can tell you proudly that Ted Cruz would not like our state at all, at least the Portland area.  So as news rolled last night that the Kasich and Cruz campaigns have apparently agreed to coordinate primaries to best keep Trump from gaining the magic number of delegates, it was no surprise that Cruz agreed to let Kasich have Oregon and New Mexico in exchange for Indiana.  Whether Cruz actually follows through or stabs Kasich in the back as he does with everyone else remains to be seen, but Cruz has no chance to win Oregon’s Republican primary.  With the largest percentage on non-religious people per capita in the state and a largely Progressive population, Ted Cruz would have a better chance convincing Oregonians he’s actually a woman than he does of convincing them to vote for him.  For once, I’ll thank Ted Cruz for not even bothering showing up to my home state.  It’s embarrassing enough to have him living in the same country as I do."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Our system for electing politicians, creating rules and regulations and basically everything tied to the government is broken, corrupt and filled with greed.  Bernie Sanders has emphatically made that the centerpiece of his campaign, and I have much respect for Bernie for mentioning this as the big problem.  With the passing of Citizens United in 2010 allowing unlimited cash flow to campaigns, it’s easy for those without money to get any say at all, having their voices drowned out by money and big corporations.  Gerrymandering congressional districts designed to drown out minority voters, prejudice tactics to keep people from voting and congressional rules that prevent bills from even reaching the floor have turned our system into a cesspool for corruption.  Bernie Sanders inspires people to understand the voice for the common man, which is why people are enthusiastic for him."
            },{
                "paragraph": "But the downside to Bernie Sanders is his ideas of fixing the broken system.  I wish we could live in a Utopia like he offers, with free healthcare, free college tuition, $15.00 plus minimum wage, and a total dismantling of the millionaires and billionaires of Wall Street.  But it’s never going to happen.  We’re always going to have Republicans on the other side who find these ideas too expensive and burdensome for the wealthy.  Like it or not, some Republicans have decent ideas and fiscally speaking, they’re worth at least exploring as a compromise; unfortunately, their voices are drowned out by the extremists unwilling to negotiate and expecting their way.  This is where Bernie Sanders ultimately fails to me.  I don’t see him having the balls to be aggressive and standing up to these Republicans if leading the way.  Another issue I have with Bernie is my appreciation for moderation.  Nothing about Bernie economically says moderation.  It’s all about attacking Wall Street and their rich snobs.  While it’s true they are driven by greed and power, I also find it necessary for us to work together, not pit sides against another.  We need to find ways to work with them for more business friendly ideas to improve the economy.  Like anything, being in the middle represents the best of both worlds, and the only realistic way to get anything done.  To me, Hillary Clinton would be an easy choice for this except for her sometimes brash personality and somewhat goofy immature attitude she displays."
            },{
                "paragraph": "Hillary Clinton, unlike Bernie Sanders, is more well-rounded with experience on all sides of the issues, from economic to foreign policy issues, and clearly has the personality to get things done, never afraid to fight.  But yet her ideas are average at best, as she’s being drawn further to the left to fend off Bernie Sanders’ obvious charismatic ways.  I know Hillary Clinton would be better handled to tackle on foreign policy issues, a big concern of mine with her experience as Secretary of State, and she has more balls to tackle on the Republicans across the aisle, but Republicans have an extreme hatred for Hillary Clinton and would treat her as they have Obama for the past seven years.  Unfortunately, I’m not convinced Hillary would be any more willing to reason with them than they would with her.  During the first Democratic debate, Hillary declared Republicans as her favorite enemy, kind of an immature thing to say to me."
            },{
                "paragraph": "But in terms of ideas, her beliefs are more reasonable, such as improving Obamacare to be more cost friendly rather than completely revamp it as a single-payer system with Medicare for all, which again, sounds nice, but isn’t realistic.  They aren’t nearly as far-fetched as Bernie Sanders extreme ideas.  But yet, Hillary doesn’t excite me at all.  Her personality is a turnoff for me, and I do consider her somewhat of an opportunist, changing beliefs to better fit her electorate rather than being the more centrist Democrat her husband Bill was, which made him the best President of my lifetime, in my opinion (keep in mind I was born in the Reagan days)."
            },{
                "paragraph": "I'm confident both races in Oregon will be one-sided.  Oregon is ripe with Progressives who love Bernie.  Most bumper stickers I see are for Bernie Sanders, and it’s no surprise for me.  Bernie will beat Hillary easily, with the young white electorate far outweighing the minority support which Oregon doesn't have much of.  The Republicans are less clear but Donald Trump fits the angry Republicans better than Ted Cruz the religious nutcase.  The fact he would let John Kasich have a better opportunity says that Ted Cruz could never win our state, he could only win the state if he was the only candidate, and even then he would barely beat ‘Other’. So Donald Trump is the likely winner on the Republican side."
            },{
                "paragraph": "In the end, while my heart says Bernie Sanders is the best choice, for understanding people’s frustrations with the system the best, my brain says Hillary Clinton for providing the most realistic approach to solving problems and being the most experienced person to handle our problems.  Whether I should follow my heart or my brain is the big issue I haven't settled completely on yet.  The rest of me says anyone but Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, as those two imbeciles would turn our country into a joke.  In the end, that's the most important thing to me."

                "paragraph": "When people refer to “The Day the Music Died,” they are referring to the tragic death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper when they perished in a plane crash outside of Clear Lake, Iowa on February 3, 1959.  Yet years later, we’ve lost many musicians with a far bigger influence.  With apologies to Elvis Presley, John Lennon, everyone in the “27 Club” (Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and more recently, Amy Winehouse), we’ve seen two deaths in the music world truly crushing since that day.  The second was of course, Michael Jackson’s tragic death on June 25, 2009, and the third was today, as Prince passed away."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "For those who have followed Prince’s music, know him as the definition of eclectic, reaching all aisles of the music spectrum blended perfectly to a sound known simply as the ‘Minneapolis Sound.’  Whether it was rock, R&B, pop, whatever it was, Prince knew just how to make the perfect harmony with a mesh of styles.  As a music enthusiast and a well-known perfectionist, Prince was and is the defining artist for those aiming to reach all aisles of the map.  Many artists today, including Andre 3000 from Outkast and Janelle Monae are often compared to Prince for their various stylings of music.  But none of them can be Prince."

But yet Prince always knew the appropriate way to reach his platform.  His performance at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007 was the best performance I’ve ever seen.  Many others including Billboard Magazine agree, as Prince showcased his electric styling of his songs and covers of other songs, which concluded with Purple Pain while it was actually raining, creating the perfect purple glow from the lighting.  But Prince also had more intimate surprise shows perfect for the smaller crowd.  Prince had everything covered when it came to performance."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The first song I ever purchased on iTunes was ‘When Doves Cry,’ a classic example of Prince’s Minneapolis Sound and one of his biggest hits, from the album that pushed him to superstardom, Purple Rain.  A soundtrack of a movie of the same name starring Prince as ‘The Kid,’ though I thought the movie was somewhat corny, based somewhat on his life, it’s the music that people most remember about Prince.  Though Prince’s acting career didn’t last too long, his music never stopped, spanning from 1978 till today, featuring classic hits including ‘When Doves Cry,’ ‘Purple Rain,’ ‘1999,’ ‘Raspberry Beret’ and many more."

He famously squabbled with his record label Warner Bros. for ownership and control of his music, changing his name to an unpronounceable symbol (people referred to him as ‘The Artist formerly known as Prince’).  To many, Prince was an idol in the music industry for standing up to his bosses and demanding creativity and freedom.  Of course, the flip side of this was that Prince did everything he could to keep his music off the Internet, demanding fansites taken down and performances removed from sites like youTube as Prince wanted compensation for his works."

From musicians, entertainers, athletes and even the politicians, chances are people right now are sad to see Prince go, probably listening to his past hits, wondering what the heck happened.  I always considered it my dream Halloween costume to dress up like Prince, complete with the purple suit, guitar and wild hair.  That would have been the dream for me, but I could never pull it off, sadly.  It would have been mind-blowing.  As an adopted Minnesotan, having gone to school at the University of Minnesota, I remember seeing First Avenue, driving by Paisley Park in Chanhassen, all while blasting his music.  He will be missed.  Heaven just got a lot funkier."

As I watched Kobe take shot after shot after shot, I wondered if he was really trying to reach 50 points.  The announcers mentioned that could be the case in the first quarter.  I would have been happy with 40 points.  The plan was to sit Kobe the first half of the fourth quarter.  That didn’t happen.  Suddenly, the race to 50 was on."

As the game drew closer to the end, Kobe kept making shots, and with some nice dunks from Larry Nance Jr. and some other great plays, the crowd was going nuts.

Down by 6, I jokingly thought to myself, ‘Kobe is aiming for 60 points, not 50.’  A couple of shots made later, he actually had a shot at that goal.  I was shocked, he looked tired, playing 42 minutes at 37 years old, but Kobe has made a career of playing with lots of pain.  A few shots later and with Utah missing a bunch of shots, Kobe reached the free throw line with two free throws needed for 60.  He made them both easy-peasy, giving them a three point lead.  After a steal from Kobe on the next play, he threw it down court to Jordan Clarkson for the slam, putting the icing on the cake.  Kobe left the game for the last time with 4 seconds left as the Lakers won 101-96 in a thrilling game, finishing an incredible 60 point game.  Sure, Kobe took 50 shots, but it was his last game, so who cares.  Haters can hate.  A Nike commercial starring Kobe made that clear, he loves the hate, he feeds off the hate.  When it was all said and done, I stood up and applauded a fitting farewell for Kobe."

After the balloons went down, Kobe got to address the fans one last time, thanking the fans, his journey playing twenty years for his favorite childhood dream, and honoring the bad years as his favorite for all the hard work and never giving up.  He ended his speech simply put ‘Mamba out.’  Close to how I ended my blog."

There was no other like him, he drove off the pain, the bad games, the fans jeering, it just made Kobe more determined.  The NBA will miss that for sure.  Too many players now want Super Teams to make it easy on themselves.  LeBron ran from the hard times, ran from home to play in Miami, only to realize it was a mistake despite winning two Championships and went back to Cleveland.  But instead of fighting through it, he complains.  No wonder Kobe’s had more success.  But that’s another subject to debate.  And of course, on the same night the Golden State Warriors won their 73rd win to break the single-season record, it’s Kobe who proved again who the real star was."

This season was nothing more than the Kobe Farewell show, and they knew it.  They had their lowest wins in a season ever, even less than last year's worst season ever.  They have young talent, lots of cap room and hopefully a top three pick in the NBA Draft (here’s hoping they get the Number 1 pick).  But getting a high class free-agent will be almost impossible since there’s no one ready to be a superstar now.  They will need to build through the draft.  D’Angelo Russell showed potential to be a star; hopefully not having Kobe around will let him blossom.  He needs to mature both on and off the court, but Kobe wasn’t exactly great at 19 years old.  Jordan Clarkson is a solid player worth keeping, with both the heart and talent to succeed.  Julius Randle has some freakish talents but like Russell is quite young and not yet mature.  The rest of the team is give and take; Roy Hibbert is useless and off the books, won’t be back.  Nick Young is terrible for Byron Scott’s style of play (if Scott even remains as coach, not a given), and being secretly recorded by Russell for no good reason left him hurt.  Lou Williams is a nice bench player but would probably want a better team to play for.  Larry Nance Jr. showed nice energy and has great dunking abilities (like his dad).

Kobe has had plenty of great moments, after 20 years it’s hard to remember all of them.

Put it simply, he’s the best to wear the Purple and Gold.  I’ve never seen Kobe smile as much as I’ve seen now.  And for Magic Johnson’s proclamation of Kobe’s 81 point night, I was in living in Eugene at my apartment.  My Dad had come to visit that night, and we had sushi for dinner.

Today, it comes as no surprise that Shaquille O’Neal, a man who needs no introduction, was selected to join the Basketball Hall of Fame.  There was never a player like Shaq when he was playing, and with the changing of the style of play in professional basketball, there will probably never be a player as dominant and larger-than-life as Shaq, both physically and verbally."

I certainly had my share of Shaq memorabilia when I was young; toys, posters, video games, etc.  I even saw him star in the crappy Kazaam movie, where Shaq played a genie.  But as a player, Shaq had yet to reach his prime, and when he did, it was scary."

Perhaps the only center that could play effectively against Shaq at the time, but with a different skill set, Shaq’s turn was coming.  But it wasn't in Orlando, a place Shaq referred to as a pond.

Along with the rise of talented youngster Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were soon the team to beat as Shaq reached the prime of his career, and watching him play, there was nothing anyone could do to slow him down.  His size, strength and footwork made Shaq unstoppable, with no one even close to slowing him down, and having Phil Jackson as coach, Shaq was disciplined and motivated to win, win, win, as the Lakers won three in a row from 2000-2002.  Sure, people could Hack-A-Shaq him and make him shoot free throws, his only weakness, but seriously, how many teams were successfully able to comeback and win from Hack-A-Shaq?  While Kobe was and is my favorite player, anyone with half a brain could tell you that Shaq was the first option and best reason for the Lakers dominance.  His MVP winning 2000 season was perhaps the most dominating year anyone has ever had in the NBA, one vote shy of an unanimous MVP vote, and it’s hard to believe Allen Iverson got one vote."

The feud between the two was rather stupid, mostly coming from Shaq’s end, with the constant name calling and references to ‘he who shall not be named.’  But looking back, it probably was kind of foolish to be too harsh against Shaq, as he’s always been the goofy funny guy who doesn’t take too much seriously.  All his nicknames, comments and outside forms of entertainment, it seemed like a plea for attention, and it was true, Shaq did it for the attention.  There was obviously something boiling deep down, but not as extreme as it seemed.  Kobe made his comments, but they were much more calculated.

With the NBA becoming a guard's game, no one has even come close as a center to matching Shaq, and it may not ever get there.  The NBA All-Star doesn't have a vote for strictly centers, because of the lack of talented centers.  Big men are rarely if ever seen as a high priority in the draft.  Even the Lakers, home of some of the best Centers ever to play in the NBA (Shaq included), took point guard D’Angelo Russell last year with the second pick in the draft to be the future of their franchise, passing up big men Jahlil Okafor and Kristaps Porzingis.  So while we now play in a guard’s game, where the best player today weighs about half of Shaq’s size (Steph Curry), it's unfortunate that the NBA may never see a player like Shaq again, both in stature and character."

To hear North Carolinians talk, it’s no longer safe to go into a restroom without wondering who might sneak up from behind and attack you.  You might as well not use public restrooms at all in the state of North Carolina, because suddenly, there has been an increase of men going into women’s restrooms and attacking them, except for the fact, of course, that men aren’t illegally going into women’s restrooms and they’re definitely not attacking them.

But while these religious bigots see the world as black and white, most people understand the complexity of the world in regards to people.  I don’t understand why anyone would want to identify as the opposite sex, nor is it my place to make that determination.  It’s up to the individual to live as they feel best.  The North Carolina bigots on the other hand, expect them to live as ‘God’ intended them to, no ifs ands or buts.  That's why Governor Pat McCrory and all the other supporters of HB 2, a.k.a. the bathroom bill refer to transgendered as men that want to use women’s bathrooms.  Never an issue with actual men going into women’s restrooms, which is not allowed anyway, but it only became a political issue because their transgendered women.  They are filled with fear and confusion, ignoring the fact that transgendered people are far more likely to be a victim of violence than the perpetrator of violence, especially if they enter the men's restroom.  A transgendered woman is far more likely to be questioned in a men’s restroom than they are in a woman’s restroom, because of their external appearance, not what they keep under their underwear.  They ignore women going into men’s bathrooms, proving that not only are they bigots who hate LGBT folks, but also sexist to boot because they’re target women who identify as men, not the other way around.  People are capable of making their own decisions, that’s not up for the Government to do, nor is it up to them to control our bathroom preferences and bedroom preferences."

I don’t ever pay attention who’s in the bathroom with me; most people don’t, so chances are, I would probably feel unsafe in a North Carolina public restroom wondering if people would ever think I’m transgendered, because apparently, that’s what people do in North Carolina, observe everyone that comes and goes out of the restroom by checking their genitalia.  That's pretty gay by the way, since 99% of people in any given bathroom are of the same sex.  Thankfully, the state of North Carolina has a Democrat for an Attorney General, Roy Cooper, who has already declared that not only does he not support this nor intends to enforce it, that he refuses to defend it in the oncoming onslaught of lawsuits filed or being filed against the constitutionality of North Carolina’s bathroom patrol.  He’s running for Governor in the state, hopefully he wins over current Governor and wang watcher Pat McCrory.

They live their lives strictly by the Bible, even when they’re contradicting the parts of the Bible which say ‘love thy neighbor as you would love thyself’ or whatever they say by expressing fear and hatred towards the LGBT community and treating them like diseases.  They look at everyone with their gaydar’s up and running, wondering if anyone they come across is gay, lesbian or a transgendered person, and often judge them if they are.  Somehow, they are automatically worse for not following God than these religious folks are, even if they’re following the laws and believe in God themselves.  The religious bigots act pure yet many of them are hypocrites, cheating on their spouses, stealing from others, whatever it may be.  Anyone can be bad, not just those in the LGBT community.

Telling a transgendered person they are somehow inferior or dangerous for being the opposite sex of what they identify as sets a bad precedent in the business world, where the consumer is always right, and it fails in the public realm too, where people have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, rather than have the Government and hateful xenophobes telling them how to live it.

It’s not a radical idea as they claim; it’s been in effect in Oregon for years and hasn’t affected me at all, nor does it affect any of the anti-LGBT religious nuts trying to discriminate against them.  The sky hasn’t fallen, the world is not on fire and if any transgendered person has been in the same bathroom as me, I likely wouldn’t have noticed, since it’s not on my agenda to keep track of people in the bathroom.  So please North Carolina religious nuts, just move on with your lives.  Take your kids to school and don’t spend your time scoping out the bathrooms.  Do your job and when you need to go to the bathroom, just go to the bathroom.  Don’t be afraid of your surroundings.

That was an impressive game as I’ve seen the Ducks play, beating the defending Champs.  All talk about the game has gone towards Mike Krzyzewski complaining about Dillon Brooks three pointer with 6 seconds left and denying it.

Without a true star, the Wildcats have plenty of solid players who play with their hearts, coached by George Clooney’s look-a-like, Jay Wright.

Surely, the people who questioned them need to shut up, never doubt Jim Boeheim and their zone defense.

It will be closer than their previous match up, but Oklahoma has the talent and the heart to match up against Villanova's heart.  Should be a great game either way.  The other match-up, an All-ACC affair, matches up North Carolina against Syracuse.  Virginia has always been a tad overrated in my opinion, but not North Carolina.  They’ll easily beat Syracuse.

Northern Iowa’s game-winning half court shot against Texas was stunning; best shot in the Tournament.  Seeing it live left me in awe.  Even more stunning was blowing a 12-point lead against Texas A&M with 35 seconds left (Northern Iowa ended up losing in overtime).  I kept watching the Oregon-Duke game thinking 'don’t be like Northern Iowa, this game's not over, just ask Northern Iowa' at the end.  Dillon Brooks put the nail in the coffin thankfully.  Hawaii became the first team from outside the continental U.S. to win an NCAA game.  Of course, they're the only Division I team outside the continental U.S., which makes it less impressive.  Stephen F. Austin’s Thomas Walkup is an impressive player, from his haircut to his game; heartbreaking to see Notre Dame beat them at the last second.  St. Joseph’s DeAndre Bembry played well against Cincinnati and Oregon, he’s got skills and an impressive Afro (best since Josh Childress back in the day).  Plenty of people dislike Duke's Grayson Allen for being annoying, especially with the tripping, but watching Oregon-Duke, I found Marshall Plumlee to be even more annoying, just like the other Plumlee’s.  Little Rock’s win over Purdue was sweet, Josh Nagin played out of his mind.  I thought they had a chance, I was right, but didn’t pick it.  Congrats to them.  I figured Oregon's chances against Duke were good as they struggled against Yale, congrats to them.  Hopefully this is the beginning of a great run for Oregon.  Elgin Cook's a Senior, but the other key players hopefully will be back.  Chris Boucher won an extra year of eligibility, and Freshman Tyler Dorsey might go pro, but both need another year to improve their games.  Chris Boucher is the definition of Raw talent, while Tyler Dorsey wasn't that impressive against Duke or Oklahoma.  Any way you look at it, it has been a great March Madness.  See you next year."

But yet, these same people overlook the fact that he was nothing more than an Anti-Government terrorist wanting something that wasn’t legally his.  Would these same people have reacted as such if he was Islamic?  Hardly, they would have slapped him with a ‘Terrorist’ label and treated him as an enemy, not some folk-hero fighting the big guy.

You simply can’t tell the government that you no longer will follow its rules without facing the consequences: they're call rules.  You have to respect the Government and not fight them to the death as he did.  He clearly told FBI agents to ‘go ahead and shoot him’ and as a gun-toting false Patriot, he was armed to the tooth and nail.  That’s the only reason the standoff was able to last as long as it did, because they threatened everyone with guns.  Even though he made numerous references to this, people treat him like some sort of prophet who died to protect them.  But really, he was a coward who wants everything for free, just like his idiot leader Cliven Bundy, who hates the Government and believes they have no authority, yet has no problem accepting a Government-funded public defenders.  Where does the money come from to pay these attorneys?  The government."

He blatantly broke the law with all of his scumbag buddies by holding a federal wildlife refuge hostage and threatening to shoot those who tried to stop them, and when the FBI caught them in their tracks, Finicum threatened to shoot the cops and was killed for not complying.  These are not characteristics of a hero, but actually characteristics of a terrorist, just like the radical Islamic terrorist groups that many of his followers assume are the only terrorists around.

Unfortunately for Virginia, Michigan State is in their bracket, having lost to them in the Tournament two years in the row.

Still, as a Minnesota Golden Gopher graduate, I can tell you that Minnesota lost to South Dakota State but beat Maryland.  So I’m going to make that my upset pick, though I’m not very confident on it.  And keep in my mind Golden Gophers had a poor season (beating Maryland was their only impressive win).  I also like 11 seed Gonzaga to upset 6 seed Seton Hall.  Despite a disappointing season for the Zags, they still have a talented squad.  Another upset I like is 10 seed VCU over 7 seed Oregon State.  First off, congrats to the Beavers for finally making it after 26 years.  They’ve been impressive enough with Coach Tinkle doing a great job with limited talent, and of course, Gary Payton II is just like his dad.

Another case of a mid-major team being left out in favor of a mediocre major conference team, i.e. Syracuse, who had a lower RPI than Monmouth.

Oklahoma has possibly the best player in the Tournament with Buddy Hield, an elite scorer and possible top pick in the NBA Draft.  Baylor’s style of play is always tough to handle, though Oregon beat them to begin the season.  Oregon has the talent to make the Final Four, but their depth is a minor issue, as they only play 7 players regularly.  But their top players play really well, defend really well, and are really unselfish, all defining characteristics of their coach Dana Altman.

I don’t think Oregon has the depth to beat Kansas (nor the experience), and Michigan State has the best overall talented player in the country, Denzel Valentine, tough to the bone and ready to play.

It was easier to pick these play-in games when I did my brackets on paper: I always picked the team with the shorter name.  Doesn’t matter now.  Other times, I wonder just a little; for example, Arkansas Little Rock, with a 29-4 record could very well beat Purdue, but my heart tells me not to pick against the Boilermakers.  In fact, I believe they’ll deny Virginia a third shot at the Spartans in as many years.  I try to be as unbiased as possible, although it’s difficult when Oregon is in as a #1 Seed.

Tech giants, like Apple and Google, have every right to be concerned about the implications creating a back-door has on the larger population.  After all, our society has become so technology dependent that basically everyone has and uses something that contain our data.

If the government had the ability to hack into someone’s phone, who knows what they would do in the name of safety.

Senate lead majority Mitch McConnell, who infamously stated his goal was to make Obama a one-term President, is now casted by the extremist right as 'not conservative enough,' even though there's nothing moderate about him.  Yet Republicans today think McConnell and former Speaker of the House John Boehner didn't do enough to fight for their needs.  Ignoring the simple fact that the Democrats were in control and they were outnumbered, Republicans today expect that they will always win, even when outnumbered, as if the Elections of 2008 and 2012 never happened.  They don't care about anyone who's not Conservative, blasting Democrats as un-American and not one of them."

Somehow, they think he has all the control, even though Congress is in charge of producing and passing bills, which they are clearly incapable of doing.  They act like the Constitution must be followed, and accuse Obama of not following the Constitution, even though they like to ignore parts of the Constitution that leave them at a disadvantage, i.e., the equal rights protection that allows gays to get married, and the sudden invention of a clause that a President can't nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the last year of office, a clause which doesn't exist.

Bill Clinton's fault beforehand, or b. The Democrat controlled Senate and House's fault.

But while Democrats are more acceptable to change, Republicans are stubborn and expect things to stay the same.  Whether they actually come to terms with this remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: Republicans aren't going to accomplish anything when they keep trying the same exclusionary tricks they always have in a time where the very people they exclude are the ones who are gaining the power.

I was too young to watch the classic Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins battles, but I've seen plenty of highlights of their battles.  To me, Vince Carter's dunks in the 2000 contest were the best ever.  It was a contest to remember, everyone who saw that contest knew it was his, even Vince Carter, who motioned to the camera that 'it was over.'  But that also brought a rapid decline afterwards, as the dunks got more repetitive, the players became less interesting, the format got worse and the players kept missing their dunks, sucking all the life force out of their attempts.  Not to mention the lame props, the mascots, Dwight Howard's Superman costume, Blake Griffin dunking over a Kia Optima, etc."

A rookie for the Minnesota Timberwolves, the dunks he made were not only mind-blowing, but he made them look so effortlessly that it was hard to believe they were difficult at all, but they were.  He didn't need props, he just dunked.  He won that contest easily, and of course, he took the opportunity to defend his title.  Most people, myself included, felt the contest was his to lose.  The other three players didn't seem worthy, Andre Drummond, Will Barton and Aaron Gordon, all first timers.  After the contest was over tonight, it's clear the Slam Dunk Contest has finally awoken.  Back with a vengeance, and again, the best of Saturday Night."

Amar'e Stoudemire did this years ago with Nash, but Stoudemire's was better, and Nash's poor soccer skills reminded me of why his stint with the Lakers was quite terrible.  Will Barton had a nice first dunk, but missed his second.  His best performance was his Thriller dance, sad to say."

The first one was not good, but his second one, jumping over the Orlando Magic mascot Stuff the Magic Dragon, had some difficulty to it, making it more impressive.  One thing about the Slam Dunk contest is that some dunks look better in slo-mo than in real life.  This dunk was no exception as Gordon jumped over Stuff and brought it back up for the slam, with a score of 49.  Zach LaVine was equally as impressive as the first time, jumping from about the free throw line for an alley-oop.  Why Shaq gave both Gordon's and LaVine's second dunks a 9 is perhaps the biggest mystery.  But it set up for the best final round of all time."

LaVine did almost the same thing without the mascot and pose.  Both got a 50.  But Gordon's seemed like it would be a 55 if that was even possible.  I might've understood both 50's if LaVine had gone first, but he went last.  Either way, both very impressive, plus it led to the greatest duel since MJ-Nique in 1988."

It was enough to get everyone out of their chairs.  Of course he got a 50, yet could have gotten a 60 if that was possible.  Not to be outdone, LaVine did a windmill dunk from the free-throw line.  An impressive dunk, another perfect 50.  So with each getting two perfect 50s in the final round, it was time for a dunk-off."

Another effortless 50 for Gordon, and LaVine responded with another 50 dunk.  Tied again, another dunk-off was needed and again, two perfect 50's, with more impressive dunks.  By the third dunk-off, Gordon appeared to be out of ideas.  Was this the end for Aaron Gordon?  His dunk, putting the ball over his head, back down to his knees and up for the dunk was impressive, but he only got a 47 since it seemed rather pedestrian to his other mind-boggling slams.  Now LaVine had an opening, and he too didn't know what to do.  How did he respond to the opening?  A between the legs dunk from just under the free-throw line.  A dunk he admitted he never tried before.  Perfect 50, game over, advantage: Zach LaVine, who only got docked one point by Shaq the entire night."

In virtually every other year before last year, he would have easily won it with the dunks he made; they were out of this world.  Only Zach LaVine could match him.  And trust me, LaVine was impressive.  Dunking from the free-throw line (essentially the free-throw line, but still, Dr. J wasn't perfect either when he did it in 1976) is impressive enough, but an alley-oop, windmill and between the legs from the free-throw line, all in the same night, sick!  All the dunks Zach LaVine got a 50 on, he deserved a 50. But Gordon's dunks over Stuff were downright insane, especially the one under his legs.  How is that even possible?  He managed to break my 'no-prop' rule with that dunk alone.  By the night's end, I was standing waiting to see if an ending would occur.  They could've gone at it all night long if they wanted.  Zach LaVine put it best after the contest was over, they both deserved the title.  And it was truly the sickest, craziest and best Slam Dunk Contest ever.  Only Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins battling for the title in 1988 was as competitive as this one.  But Aaron Gordon's perfect 50 dunks seemed more impressive than LaVine's perfect 50 dunks.  How can perfect be considered perfect when one perfect score is better than another perfect score?  The real winners of the night were of course, the fans, and maybe Stuff the Magic Dragon, who probably had the most fun getting dunked on and twirling on a hoverboard."

Despite indisputable proof that the Earth is round, proven over 500 years ago, B.o.B., trying to provide some reasoning to his thoughts, took to Twitter wondering why distant pictures showed no curve.  Upon hearing about this, super smart Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson called B.o.B. out for not only claiming a debunked theory about the Earth as true, but called him dangerous for even suggesting it, explaining how we know the Earth is round.  Though Tyson isn't a rapper (thankfully), his nephew took the opportunity to come up with a diss record to respond to B.o.B.'s 15th Century claim that the Earth is flat."

Last year, the Wu-Tang Clan made a secret album called 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,' to be sold to one lucky multi-millionaire, with the condition he/she could not profit off the album in any way, shape or form for 88 years.  Sounds stupid, we'll probably hear it within 2 years, but that's another story.  But Martin Shkreli, then the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the album for over 2 million dollars (allegedly).  By the time Shkreli became publically known as the guy who bought the album, he became infamously known for raising the price of a life-saving AIDS drug over 5000%, drawing scorn from just about everyone with a soul.  RZA, the mastermind behind the project, was displeased and criticized him, proclaiming the profits were given to charity after news of Shkreli's actions, and subsequent arrests for fraud, were made public.

This led to a bunch of whining from Shkreli, who also demanded an apology for being called a shithead.  But just when you thought this couldn't get any crazier, Martin Shkreli was called to testify to the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about his extreme price hike of the life-saving Daraprim from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill.  Not surprisingly, he plead the fifth the entire time, refusing the answer any questions while smirking and calling the Congressmen as 'imbeciles.'  While this action isn't surprising, he was awkwardly asked by chairman Trey Gowdy about his purchase of the Wu-Tang secret album.  Shkreli plead the fifth on that too.  Nothing incriminating about that, but nonetheless, stupid."

Sure, when I walk outside, I don't see any curves.  When seeing things far apart from a distance, I don't see any curves. I don't need to go into the specifics as to how the Earth is clearly round, Neil deGrasse Tyson is much smarter than me (and most people in fact) and he provided a clear, concise and very articulate response.  It got a little corny when Tyson's nephew rapped, but that's expected from someone looking for any sort of fame.  Still it's sad that someone questioned something clearly proven centuries ago."

Rappers feuding with businessmen, TV personalities and so and so is nothing new.  Dr. Dre slapped TV host Dee Barnes, Ludacris feuded with Bill O'Reilly over his Pepsi endorsement, Mac Miller caught Donald Trump's wrath for not paying him for naming a song after him, and Eminem's many beefs with just about everyone in the media you could imagine.  And with the unfortunate invention of Twitter, rappers and other celebrities can argue virtually over 140 character tweets, sending off rapid fire tweets with minimal effort.  It's sadly a more frequent occurrence.  But Martin Shkreli's purchase of the Wu-Tang album, which he admitted to having, even suggesting he'd destroy the album, gave a backdrop to an odd interaction with Congressman Trey Gowdy, a man who doesn't know who the Wu-Tang Clan is.  Yet here he is asking about the purchase of this album, nothing to do with the price hike, nothing to do with anything other than to get any response from Shkreli, and he still wouldn't say anything other than 'I plead the fifth.'  No wonder Trey Gowdy got nowhere with Hillary Clinton."

But we would expect that when the rap gods suddenly find themselves back in time.  Arguing something proven false over 500 years ago while trying to sound intelligent in the process is a lame excuse for trying to prove yourself as a great lyricist.  Ironic for someone who released a song called 'Airplanes,' which wouldn't be able to fly around the world if the Earth was flat."

As the first round proceeded and Johnny still on the board, I wondered who would be stupid enough to take him.  Suddenly, the 22nd pick rolled around and the Philadelphia Eagles, eager to trade down, had two teams interested in acquiring the pick, Cleveland and Minnesota; two teams that needed a quarterback.  It wasn't known until after the draft that Minnesota made an offer, but Cleveland had the stronger offer and acquired the pick, drafting Manziel, who called Cleveland's GM and told him 'let's wreck this league together.'

He said he would, but yet admitted he didn't spend much time studying the playbook.  Be prepared as a backup?  He said he was but yet his interests were elsewhere and wasn't ready to take the starting job from an otherwise average Brian Hoyer.  Partying with the Drake's of the world, throwing parties after being sidelined for the rest of the season with an injury and getting pissed drunk when he was supposed to be preparing with the team, these were the things Johnny Manziel was most interested in.  By the time he actually got to play a game, late in the season, he was embarrassed and produced very little offense, all while getting mocked by his opponents for his obnoxious “money sign.”  He only started two games, getting injured in the second one, and yet after his injury, he threw a party and got wasted when he was supposed to report to team activities.  Everything I saw in Johnny Manziel in college ended up getting worse in the NFL, and that's solely his personal life.  His performance on the field was terrible.

He spent ten weeks in rehab,  and not surprisingly it didn't help all that much.  Second season around, Johnny Manziel got more playing time, and he did play somewhat decent at times, but all the stories anyone wanted to talk about were his secret trips to Vegas that he promised his coaches he wouldn't go on, getting pulled over by the police for domestic incidents, and not checking in with the team for required concussion tests (he was partying, no surprise), not to mention lying to his coaches about these distractions."

So as to no surprise to me, Johnny Manziel's career in Cleveland ended up exactly as I thought, little on-the-field production with a lot of bad behavior and controversy.  My gut feeling tells me that Manziel wanted out of Cleveland and acted up on purpose, but his type of behavior could lead to little interest and being completely out of the league in a few years (if not earlier), rendering him a complete bust.

As reports appeared that Manziel repeatedly smacked his now ex-girlfriend, threatened to kill her and himself, along with his father speaking to the media today (February 5, 2016) trying to get Manziel into rehab, fearing he won't reach his next birthday, now this story is sad.

Seemingly unaware of the fact that the very minorities they ridicule, bash and dehumanize are rising at a much higher rate than the voter base they are aiming for, who are dwindling and aging at record numbers.  Clearly, these two candidates think that math is stupid and only for liberals.  But math is concrete and absolute.  It can not be denied.  So how do these two idiots continue to deny math's power?"

This is not only ridiculously false, but clearly an act of fraud.  Ted Cruz's philosophy appears to be committing scams to get people to vote (for him, of course).  Similar to the IRS and other law enforcement scams that alleged Nigerian princes commit, Ted Cruz has ignored all mathematical purities by claiming that only those likely to support him can vote.  This ignores all the Democrats, moderate Republicans, Libertarians and other third party non-Extremist Republicans right to vote.  Mathematically, they far outnumber the extremist Republicans Ted Cruz thinks are the only solemn citizens of America.  Chances are, Ted Cruz would send letters to minority Democrats claiming that their voting privileges are null and void stating bogus legal laws in an effort to suppress votes for those who would never vote for him.  Ted Cruz is a manipulative heartless unlikeable extremist who only cares about himself and no one else.  Basic math states that 40% of voters will vote Republicans, 40% will vote for Democrats and 20% are undecided, and Ted Cruz thinks he can win with only 10% of the pure Republican vote by scaring people into voting for him who can't stand him."

Donald Trump has spent his entire campaign bashing Hispanics, Blacks, Women, Muslims, Handicapped, Asians, Homosexuals, basically anyone who's not an old white religious man.  Despite all of this badmouthing, Donald Trump continues to insist that Hispanics, Blacks, Women, Muslims, Handicapped and Homosexuals all like him and will support him.  If I were a Hispanic, I would definitely not vote for someone who refers to people of my ethnicity as 'drug-dealers, criminals and rapists.'  Most Hispanics are not bad people, yet Donald Trump wants you to believe all of them are.  It is far more likely that Hispanics, whose population has increased far more than any other voting bloc would vote against him than vote for him.  But Donald Trump, the master manipulator who claims anyone can like him, must have a plan to attract undecided general voters.  It's true, lying flip-flops can easily act more moderate to appeal to moderate voters, but like Mitt Romney in 2012, this would make Donald Trump more untrustworthy.  It runs the risk of alienating the racist, white-supremacist-wannabe religious gun-toting extremists that pushed him to the top.  Those people would become disenfranchised that they voted for a former Democrat as their candidate.  Not all of them would abandon Trump, as Republicans will vote Republicans simply because they are Republicans, but enough would push the tide towards Hillary Clinton (or perhaps Bernie Sanders)."

Two plus two will always equal four, no matter how hard religious people might claim that one of the two's isn't actually a two, but actually three-fifths of a two.  When one group of people rise while another one decreases, any mathematician will tell you that getting the votes of the group that's growing is better than the one that's decreasing.  Republicans can try to find ways to make people not vote, but extremists are encouraging people to vote against them rather than vote for the other candidate.  Hillary and Bernie may not perfect candidates, but math says that voting Hillary/Bernie is a vote against Donald/Ted, and many will hate Donald/Ted so much that it's important to vote against them by voting for their 'enemy'.  If Republicans ever want to get back into the White House, they're going to have to learn to trust math, not fight it.",

But ignoring mathematics has dire consequences, as the best way to truly accomplish things is by mixing your emotional feelings with mathematical realism.  Ted Cruz and Donald Trump may want you to think that math and science are unnecessary evils and try to manipulate numbers, but pure mathematics always win, and 53% will always be more than 47%."

Good, it will help you get a better understand why Ammon Bundy and his terrorist militiamen friends will face a harsh reality now that they have been arrested for taking over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.  After three weeks holding the place hostage, threatening to shoot law enforcement should they try to take them out, and leaving the people of Harney county scared, Ammon Bundy and his goons were finally arrested after 8 of them left to to attend a town meeting in the town of John Day."

Of course, most of these men, callously breaking the law by holding a federal building hostage, once they were caught, took the p***y way out and complied with the officers (the exact opposite response they threatened to take).  So much for being willing to die.  One member, the spokesmen of the group, LaVoy Finicum, held true to his word of rather being killed than going to jail, as he charged an officer and pulled out a gun before being shot and killed.  Ryan Bundy, the weird looking brother, got a minor wound for not initially complying.  Otherwise, it was a clean arrest.  The group and family members, might claim murder, but if you don't listen to the police and try to shoot, you will get shot back.  Now that Ammon Bundy and his dumb friends are charged with a felony, sitting in the Multnomah County prison in Portland, some seven hours and seemingly half the world away, now that they have complied with the law, they are in for a rude awakening."

They not only were seen at the Refuge, they frequently posted images, blogs, videos and other things on social media discussing their demands, plans, and ask for support and supplies (the fact that one person sent a bunch of sex toys is not only hilarious but fitting for a group of people at a place they don't belong receive something they don't want or need).

As convicted felons, Ammon Bundy and friends lose their privilege to own guns, as convicted felons don't have that right.  That probably won't stop any of them from illegally owning a gun, as at least one of the members was already a convicted felon, but they'll have a tougher, (albeit way too easy) of a time getting their precious guns.  Given their criminal ways and delusional thoughts, they aren't likely to obey the federal government telling them they can't own guns.  After all, second amendment fanatics think everyone has the right, even though criminals don't.  And believe me, these men are criminals.

One thing he would need to keep in mind is that it remains a beauty because the Government owns the land so no one will tarnish its beauty.  Another thing lost amongst these scoundrels.  There are some things worth protecting, and those who wish to tarnish its value for a buck need to learn the government has a right to protect its interest.  It's a lesson Bundy's dad, famed anti-government tax-cheat Cliven Bundy needs to face.

The biggest headline will likely be the probable MVP this year, Carolina QB Cam Newton, a very talented but cocky player.  There are quite a few people that find Cam Newton obnoxious and arrogant, whether it's his me-first attitude or his 'Dab' dancing whenever he scores a touchdown.  But on the other hand, how can you hate someone with a smile like his?"
            }, {

Plus at his size, he's hard to bring down.  It's the main reason Cam Newton is likely to be named MVP.  Jonathan Stewart is also a threat at the running back position, finally blossoming after Carolina ditched the two-back system with equally talented but different DeAngelo Williams.  Carolina has quite a few receivers capable of getting yardage, but Newton's favorite target is his tight end Greg Olsen, one of the better tight ends in the league.  But at the end of the day, it's all the man with the deceiving smile that is the team's most dangerous player."

This year, Peyton Manning, in what may be his last season, has been inconsistent at best, injured for six games, and at the last game of the regular season, a backup for the first time since he was a freshman in college.  Peyton did replace Brock Osweiler in that game and provided a needed spark, allowing him to regain his starting spot back, but Denver's offense isn't quite what it's used to be.  Their running game has been their most consistent part of their game, with Ron Hillman and C.J. Anderson splitting carries.  Their receivers, though talented, including Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, have not made the catches need to sustain long drives."

I have never seen a defense defend Tom Brady and his high flying passing attack better than Denver did on Sunday.  They got all kinds of pressure on Brady and sacked him multiple times.  Led by Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware on the defensive line, and with Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. in the Secondary, Denver hopes to prove that defense wins championships.  With that said, they haven't faced a Quarterback with the dual-threat capabilities like Cam Newton.  They may get deceived by that smile."

If anyone can slow him down, Denver's the team, but questions remain.  Both teams have good special teams, with accurate kickers and good punters.  Carolina has the edge with Ted Ginn Jr as its punt/kick returner, one of the most dangerous in the NFL.  Both coaches are making their Super Bowl debut, neither one has an edge."

They were even viewed as underdogs against the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round.  What did Carolina do in that game?  Score 31 points in the first half while making Seattle look pathetic.  Seattle responded in the second half but still, it was over before the second half.  They've never won a Super Bowl in franchise history, and with their young players in it for the first time, their motivation is pretty high.  But don't forget Denver.  They too were disrespected in the postseason.  Almost no one saw them beating the mighty Patriots, yet their top ranked defense flexed its muscles and slowed down Tom Brady and company.  Though they've played and won Super Bowl's before, this could very well be Peyton Manning's last game.  What better way for Peyton and the Broncos to finish the season (and his career) than being Champions?  It's the best way to end a wonderful career.  Both teams have a lot to play for in Super Bowl 50.  Whoever executes the best will be the champion."

Stole a laptop while he was at Florida and got kicked off the team.  He wound up at Auburn, won the Heisman and National Championship (sadly against my Oregon Ducks) with lots of controversy over his eligibility.  But every time I see that smile, it makes me feel happy.  I would kill for a smile like that.  So while Cam Newton acts arrogant at times, celebrates too much, and has the me-first attitude that many of the elite NBA players have, look at that smile."

                "paragraph": "So who wins Super Bowl 50?  To me, it will come down to whether Denver has the ability to slow down Newton.  Denver has the top ranked defense, and defense wins Champions, but Newton is a far different beast than the other quarterbacks Denver has faced, particularly in the postseason.  Carolina's defense should have no problem stopping Denver's mediocre offense, but if Denver can force Newton to make turnovers, it will be a tight game.  Otherwise, I expect Carolina to win easily.  Final score: Carolina 31, Denver 14.  The one thing I can guarantee with Super Bowl 50: Coldplay performing at halftime is going to suck."

        "title": "White Privilege II - Why We Need a Conversation on Race",
        "date": "January 23, 2016",
        "description": [{
                "paragraph": "Yesterday, the hip-hop game was jolted by the new song from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, 'White Privilege II,' a vicious track almost nine minutes long that discusses racism in the hip-hop world, in general, the Black Lives Matter movement, and how 'White America' is at an advantage as opposed to minorities.  Though this is not the first time Macklemore has discussed racism in his music; the original White Privilege was a song he released back in 2005, now that Macklemore is famous worldwide, the platform is expanded exponentially with his fame, social media and a generation of racism sensitivity.  Therefore, more people have a say than they did in 2005, when Macklemore was just a starving underground rapper from Seattle that until his unprecedented rise to fame, represented a city whose only taste of mainstream success was Sir Mix-a-Lot and his butt loving song Baby Got Back.  While Macklemore will never understand what it's like to actually be a black person (something he is completely aware with), this track is important nonetheless as we will never get past racism without talking about it."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Much of the initial attention is on the song's second verse, where he raps 'You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment / The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with / The culture was never yours to make better / You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea / Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic / You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in / You're branded 'hip-hop', it's so fascist and backwards / That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard.'  Not surprisingly, in a battle loving hip-hop culture, it's Macklemore calling out musicians who have appropriated black culture in their music to advance their careers, calling them out for biting the culture but not having a clue about the African-American community itself.  Though Elvis is long deceased and Miley Cyrus doesn't have much of an opinion, it was Iggy Azalea who took offense, completely missing the point of the song, instead focusing solely on herself.  Not surprising for an Australian white female pop-rapper who believes she can have street-cred acting black and be a pop rapper at the same time, which most people know can't be done.    Of course, there's more to this song than one rapper getting her feelings hurt, in a world where black people fear for their lives and feel discriminated against, this is the big picture.  The main point here is that some white artists act black to make themselves look cool but without the actual struggle the black community faces, it comes off as not authentic by any means."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Earlier in the song, Macklemore raps 'Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out? / Is it my place to give my two cents / Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth for justice? No peace / Okay, I'm saying that they're chanting out, 'Black lives matter', but I don't say it back / Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand / In front of a line of police that look the same as me.'  Suggesting that it's awkward for a white person to support movements like Black Lives Matter due to having the same skin color as the police.  Even though Macklemore understands to the extent that he can that he agrees with the black communities concerns, he fears that someone like him will get backlash as he's not a minority in the sense, and therefore, doesn't understand what they're going through.  It's a bridge that has been divided for ages, where people like Spokane NAACP president Rachel Dolezal can claim to be an African-American, but as a Caucasian, she took things too far by pretending to be black, yet claiming discrimination from a historically African-American university for being white.  It's that type of thinking of believing you can have it both ways when you can't that Macklemore alludes to here, as he can appreciate Blacks Lives Matter but can't step into their shoes as a white person."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Later in the second verse, comes these bars 'You speak about equality, but do you really mean it? / Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient? / Want people to like you, want to be accepted / That's probably why you are out here protesting.'  To me, it's saying that you can act offended when someone is hurt or attacked for their skin, religion, sexuality, etc., but you're only aware of it because you heard about it somewhere.  Most of the time, people like this act like something needs to be done, yet don't understand anything about the people themselves.  For example, you can decry racist attacks against the black community, yet until you've actually spent time with the black community, you really have no perspective on what they're actually fighting for, how they feel about society, etc.  It's akin to fighting with them, but from afar.  Again, this segregation of sorts makes things worse.  While it's true that minorities like to stick together, it also is not going to accomplish much in healing racial divides.  And for those in the majority, it diminishes your fight to protect minorities when you have no strong understanding of what you're fighting for, instead fighting for a cause simply to be fighting for a cause."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The third verse focuses on Macklemore's own career and how some people may like him solely for being white.  With lines such as 'Even an old mom like me likes it cause it's positive / You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to / Cause you get it, all that negative stuff isn't cool / Yeah, like all the guns and the drugs /The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs,' Macklemore suggests that being white makes him perceived as positive, while black rappers are all stereotyped as gangsters and thugs.  Even though there are many black rappers who aren't gangsters and thugs, such as Common, Talib Kweli and Lupe Fiasco, to name a few, they don't get the same 'respect' as Macklemore receives for their lyrics, nor do they enjoy the same commercial success Macklemore has achieved."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "One line that really struck me was on the following verse, where Macklemore writes 'It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist / Than we actually are with racism.' I find that line to be particularly powerful as many people don't even think about racism or its effects on society until they say something perceived as racist and are called racist.  It's only then that the person even thinks about racism.  Many times, I've heard people say stupid things that people interpret as racist, and the first thing these people say is 'I'm not racist.'  It's another part of being unwilling to deal with racism and its repercussions until someone accuses you of being racist because you said something that stereotypes minorities, black or not."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Another line that perfectly sums up Macklemore's views on white privilege is from these bars 'But the one thing the American dream fails to mention / Is I was many steps ahead to begin with / My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image / America feels safe with my music in their systems / And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it / And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain.' It's this type of understanding that led Macklemore to text Kendrick Lamar after winning the Grammy for Rap Album of the Year in 2014, telling Kendrick Lamar he deserved to win the award.  Macklemore felt that being white led to the voters to favor him over the black artists he was faced against.  With the recent controversy over the lack of diversity with the Oscar's, with the majority of its voters old and white, voting for actors, actresses, etc. voting for white people, it's easy to see why Macklemore released this song now (of course, it should be noted the track will appear on their upcoming album 'This Unruly Mess I've Made' to be released next month)."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Perhaps the most striking line is featured at the end of his last verse, where he repeats: 'We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by / We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?'. It basically sums up the whole song, as people tend to 'appreciate the black culture' but don't take the time to appreciate black people themselves, as if we are taking all the 'cool parts' while tossing aside the 'bad parts' of the black people (i.e. the pain and suffering).  It's definitely something that needs to be addressed, not only in the hip-hop world, but society in general.  The majority of hip-hop fans are white, yet they have not suffered the same emotions that black people have in their lives.  They have no idea what it truly is like to be black, they just think it's cool to talk slang, dance and dress all 'fresh.'  At what point do the fans truly understand what's going on?"
            }, {
                "paragraph": "So how does all of this equate to white privilege?  Musically, with the majority of fans white, whether it's hip/hop, rock n roll, pop are whatever, it comes down to fans relating more to white musicians than black musicians.  When it comes to black musicians, they are too often stereotyped as being gangsters, when they may not be.  For white musicians, they are perceived different, as if they are less threatening, even though they may be just as bad.  For these fans, they like 'black music' because it seems cool, but yet they will never live their lives, never have the same perspective, and most likely never suffer the same pain.  Macklemore has enjoyed acclaim for his work, but chances are, a black artist would get less attention releasing songs like those Macklemore has released."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "What needs to happen to get past this?  For starters, we need to confront the issues head-on.  As Macklemore alludes to in the song, remaining silent does not accomplish anything, it's basically implying that you're okay with the status quo.  We need to come together, not fight from afar to make ourselves look better.  Most important thing is that we need to understand our own shortcomings.  Too many times, those in the majority don't understand what it really is like to be a minority, to wonder if you're being targeted for being a minority.  It's also difficult for the majority to understand why minorities think that they're being targeted.  Some of it is environmental, some of it is sociological, some of it is pure genetics.  Unless you can walk in their shoes, which you can't really do, the white majority will never understand the pain and suffering the minorities suffer, nor will they realize how much easier it is to be in the majority.  Studies have suggested in the past that people have racist tendencies, whether intentional or subconscious racism, it's up for us to decide whether to ignore it or do something about it."

Donald Trump, wanting to scare people into thinking everyone is going to be attacked by a foreigner any second now, wants to diminish global warming because his party doesn't believe in it.  This of course is the same man who believes the Chinese created global warming to gain a financial edge.  But with the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, people should be more aware of global warming and the effect the environment in general has on our society."

But overlooking the global warming and environmental issues we face is more of a threat than terrorists.  Reason being, it affects everyone.  Nature doesn't discriminate.  It doesn't listen to reason.  It does whatever the situation provides.  Case in point, the water crisis in Flint.  In 2014, the Michigan state officials, determined to cut costs, temporarily used the Flint River as its water source, rather than Lake Huron, where they had been getting its water from.  They did so despite the fact that the Flint River was known to be disgusting.  They overlooked the environmental concerns by putting money first, and voila, they brought water with dangerously high levels of lead into every household in Flint, Michigan.  They eventually switched back to Lake Huron, but the damage was done."

                "paragraph": "Almost two years later, a full-blown crisis has developed in Flint.  It's unsafe to drink the tap water, and unsafe to bathe or shower in it.  Imagine living in a place where its water, which can be found everywhere, is dangerous and toxic.  Everyone needs water, to drink, to clean, to bathe, etc.  Yet Michigan state officials have slowly responded to an issue two years in the making, claiming it wasn't a concern, yet people knew their water looked, smelled and tasted bad.  They overlooked the high levels of lead, which never leaves your body once it enters it.  And despite switching water sources, it remains in all of its piping system, which is expensive to replace in a city of 100,000+ people."

Yet this problem was preventable, as spending a few extra bucks could have either kept the water source at Lake Huron, or use an anti-corrosion agent that would have cleaned the Flint River's water for $100 a day.  In an age where some politicians, like the Republican Governor of Michigan Rick Snyder, want to spend more money on the military fighting bogus wars than they do protecting the environment for those who live in the country, one must ask themselves, which is really worse, a terrorist attack or a city wide attack on water?"

With some people more concerned about cutting costs and building up our military to fight terrorists, clearly their priorities are in the wrong place.  9/11 killed 3,000 people, wounded many more, and frightened most Americans, yet living in a place where even the most ubiquitous thing available (water) is causing harm to everyone that comes in contact with it has more of an immediate effect on those around it.  This can happen anywhere, anytime without warning, and truth be told, natural elements have way more of an effect than 'foreigners.'  So while Donald Trump can claim the environment isn't worth protecting and global warming is a scam, would he or anyone like it living in Beijing, where the air is unbreathable most of the time, and people can only feel completely safe inside their home?  The rich money making man who only wants to profit doesn't care, but the majority of people need these basic elements to survive and not get sick."

                "paragraph": "Much buzz has surrounded the Netflix film-documentary 'Making a Murderer,' about a Wisconsin man named Steven Avery who spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, only to get charged and convicted of murder just two years after his release from prison.  The show and the case has attracted a lot of attention, getting enough votes for a petition on the White House's website to require the White House to answer the petition (F.Y.I. Obama can't pardon Steven Avery as the case was tried in state court, not the federal court).  The big question on everyone's mind, did Steven Avery really kill Teresa Halbach, or did someone frame him for exposing corruption for his false conviction?  Here are my thoughts on the case."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The backstory on how Steven Avery was convicted of rape in 1985 was ridiculous.  It was clear the Manitowoc County Police Department wanted to blame the crime on him no matter whether he did it or not and weren't going to consider any other plausible theories.  They ran wild with that case and wanted him behind bars because they considered him trash.  It certainly wasn't fair to treat someone that way.  And it really isn't fair that the actual perpetrator, Gregory Allen, who they knew about for his past crimes of sexual assault was able to commit more (which he did).  That part of the story is indisputable, as DNA found on the victim cleared him of any wrongdoing in 2003, and concluded Gregory Allen as the real perpetrator."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The real question many wonder is who killed Teresa Halbach?  A 25 year old photographer described with a heart of gold, she took pictures of cars at Avery's workplace, and was one of the last people to see her before she disappeared.  But did he really kill her?  Some of the initial evidence provided seemed 'too good to be true,' like the key they found next to Steven's dresser.  It seems odd to me that if he really did kill Teresa that a key would be left in open view and not disposed of.  That seems a little suspicious, especially when the police department spent 8 days on the property investigating after finding Teresa's car on the property.  8 whole days…  That seems too much time to spend at one place.  Anything could've happened during that time."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "When they charged Steven's nephew Brendan Dassey for being involved in the murder, the story got even more ridiculous.  The kid was only sixteen years old at the time and seemed too slow and not bright, yet after police interviewed him (without an attorney who wanted him to plead guilty, of course!) they came up with this elaborate story behind the murder, even though the interviewers were feeding him info and asking him questions.  Brendan didn't come out with any information on his own, he was merely answering questions as he thought the police wanted him to.  And what was described made no sense.  Wouldn't slitting someone's throat repeatedly led to physical evidence like blood in the room that allegedly took place?  Not surprisingly, none was found.  They had 8 days on the property, wouldn't they have found blood on any of the searches they did on the property?  And all from some alleged confession of a sixteen year old with a below average IQ and easy to take advantage of."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Not surprisingly, Steven Avery was convicted of two of three counts, including first degree murder.  What was interesting about the verdict was that initially seven jurors believed he was not guilty, yet they all changed their minds, three were certain he was guilty and two were undecided.  One juror ended up getting dismissed due to a family emergency, and he didn't believe there was enough evidence to convict Steven Avery.  And Brendan Dassey was convicted on all three counts, some of which were dismissed on Steven's case but not in Brendan's case.  How can he be convicted of rape, yet they dropped the charge from Steven's case even though he was the 'ringleader,' or of mutilating a corpse, which Steven was found not guilty of.  It makes no sense to me."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Is it possible that there's no conspiracy and that Steven Avery really did kill Teresa Halbach?  It could have happened, but we really don't know what actually happened.  Perhaps it was an accident.  Maybe Teresa said something to Steven that made him lose his temper and kill her.  Those things could've happened, but in the legal world, you need solid evidence of a crime happening in order to convict.  The evidence presented in the case was circumstantial at best.  No DNA of Teresa in the trailer, no blood of hers in the trailer or garage, no complete body or cause of death.  Just a few spots of Steven's blood in the RAV4.  It's possible the police planted evidence to prove Steven did it, even though Steven could have very well done it, there may have been no proof he did it.  You can never rule that out.  Based on the documentary, it doesn't seem Steven would kill Teresa, but then again, everyone has that other side that they don't want you to find out.  The side that made Steven snap in 1985 and forced his cousin off the road to confront her about rumors she spread.  There's always that possibility as well, we really don't know or probably find out."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Since it is a documentary, it paints a picture that Steven is innocent because he was falsely accused of rape in 1985, spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit and sued the Manitowoc County police department for targeting him when they had another suspect (the real suspect) that they never pursued.  Now that the documentary has been released, Special Prosecutor Ken Kratz, who led the fight against Steven Avery at the Halbach trial, now says that additional evidence was left out of the show completely.  There's so much stuff mentioned in the trial, they couldn't include it all.  Not surprisingly, none of the evidence 'left out' would make Steven guilty on its own.  Calling Teresa's business the day she showed up doesn't prove anything, nor does the structure of the dresser with the key.  And while DNA on the RAV4 may sound special, it is really reliable?  And prison hearsay of Steven Avery talking about torturing women in torture chambers.  That was the most ridiculous thing said.  It wasn't even used in the trial because it was unreliable, just like all prison snitches making ridiculous statements."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Based on everything I have read on the case, I would not have convicted Steven Avery or Brendan Dassey.  Though I can't say for certain if Steven is innocent, if you can't prove he committed a crime, then he should have been found not guilty.  There is no strong evidence proving Steven killed Teresa.  It's all circumstantial at best.  And the Manitowoc County Police Department tainted the investigation by getting involved when it wasn't supposed to.  It's possible they planted evidence, but it's possible they didn't.  The big question is, why would someone kill an innocent woman just to frame someone?  Teresa Halbach didn't deserve to die, and I have a hard time believing the police would kill her just to punish Steven Avery.  As for Brendan Dassey, he got screwed by the system.  I don't believe he did anything wrong, they just targeted him for being seen with Steven the night Teresa disappeared and because he's not very smart.  His first defense attorney openly worked with prosecution to get him to plead guilty for something he didn't do.  His 'confession' was made under pressure and probably coerced by the police.  They knew they could take advantage of him."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "As of now, Steven Avery's case has been taken over by high-powered defense attorney Kathleen Zellner, who won exonerations for 17 wrongfully convicted criminals.  An appeal has been filed, claiming the police searched his place without a valid warrant, and also claiming a juror pressured other jurors to convict him.  Whether any of this helps Steven Avery will remain to be seen.  As time goes on, technology gets more powerful and can make it easier to prove guilt or innocence in a crime.  Down the road, better testing can better prove if EDTA was in the blood sample in the RAV4.  Perhaps the bones they found can produce better evidence to tie or not tie Steven to the case.  But Steven has spent too much time in prison, first for a crime he didn't commit, and now for a crime he may or may not have committed.  As someone who likes conclusive evidence, I believe Steven should be released from prison, because at the end of the day, the only people who really know what happened is Steven Avery and Teresa Halbach.  No one else knows for certain who committed the crime, and if people like Casey Anthony, George Zimmerman and O.J. Simpson are given the benefit of the doubt, why not Steven Avery.  Innocent until PROVEN guilty, emphasis on the word proven."

        "title": "Minnesota Golden Gophers 2015 Football In Review",
        "date": "December 30, 2015",
        "description": [{
                "paragraph": "The 2015 season for the Minnesota Golden Gophers didn't quite meet the expectations that many fans might have had after a well-played 2014 season, but yet despite the bumps in the road, Minnesota is showing signs of life as a competitive football team.  Whether 2016 will be any better remains to be seen, but at the moment, Minnesota did vanquish at least one demon."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The season began with a hard fought loss to highly talented and then highly ranked TCU.  A team with an explosive offense was held to just 23 points by Minnesota's defense, and playing at home, Minnesota definitely took advantage of the crowd to the best of their abilities.  But alas, the more talented team won.  Despite this, Minnesota's hopes still remained.  The rest of the non-conference games, against Colorado State, Kent State and Ohio were all much closer than they should have been, mainly because Minnesota's offense struggled to get going, but yet they won their games, even completing a late fourth-quarter comeback against Colorado State, which ended up in overtime and a win."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The conference schedule to say the least was quite brutal.  Of their seven losses on the year, six of them were to ranked teams, the aforementioned TCU, Northwestern, Michigan, Ohio State, Iowa and Wisconsin.  They notable faced Michigan, Ohio State and Iowa three weeks in a row.  Though Minnesota wasn't beaten particularly badly in any of those games, they still could not pull the signature win they needed.  The biggest heartbreaker came against Michigan."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The same week Michigan came to town, coach Jerry Kill was forced to retire due to his seizure problems returning.  Not an easy choice for a coach who practically bleed footballs, but Kill's health is more important, as part of the intensity that got him to where he was was contributing to his seizures.  It was a sad day for the Golden Gophers when he left, but yet to me, Jerry Kill has perhaps started a foundation that I hope stays with the Golden Gophers for many years to come.  Then came the Michigan game, which Minnesota outplayed Michigan virtually the entire game, but with 19 seconds down by three, Minnesota appeared to have caught the winning touchdown, but replays showed him inches short.  Perhaps due to being shocked and frazzled, Minnesota let the clock run down far too much and eventually tried to sneak in the winning touchdown, as opposed to tying it with a field goal.  Sadly, quarterback Mitch Leidner was stuffed by the defense."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The Gophers were competitive, but ultimately, the Golden Gophers finished the regular season 5-7.  But despite the losing record, in these days, where we have way too many bowl games, there weren't enough winning teams to place in all 40 bowl games, as with only 77 teams .500 or above, 3 teams with losing records had to be invited to play.  For once, academics paid off, as Minnesota had one of the highest Academic Progress Rates amongst the 5-7 teams.  Thanks to this criteria, Minnesota joined Nebraska and San Jose State in the bowl games.  Thus, Minnesota was off to the Quick Lane Bowl to play Central Michigan.  With Minnesota making no apologies for being there, not wanting to finish 5-8 and the extra motivation of a seven game bowl losing streak (who could forget the 31 point lead they blew in 2006 in the Insight Bowl to Texas Tech), Minnesota ended its season with a high note, beating Central Michigan 21-14 to win the Quick Lane Bowl."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Looking back, the season was a minor disappointment, but with an incredibly tough schedule (with teams like Michigan and Iowa, whom the Gophers had beaten last season, were far better teams this year), and losing key offensive players David Cobb and Maxx Williams last season definitely hurt the Gophers.  Maxx Williams is hard to replace, a freakishly talented tight end, and while Minnesota have some young talented running backs with Shannon Brooks and Rodney Smith, neither one could replace the talent of Cobb.  On the plus side, Mitch Leidner, though he started off really slow, he found his rhythm later in the season, showed his heart and helped the Gophers win their bowl game.  Their defense played well, but had their weaknesses as well which need to be fixed.  And as for the coaching staff, Tracy Claeys, Jerry Kill's trusty defensive coordinator, was promoted to head coach a couple of weeks after Kill stepped down.  The Gophers have a bright future ahead, a stable coaching staff and a fanbase that's starting to show up and appreciate the team.  Let's hope 2016 is a step in the right direction."

                "paragraph": "Another year has gone by, and for an avid hip-hop fan like myself, I can sum up the year in general as mediocre.  While Kendrick Lamar continued his onslaught as the most talented rapper at the moment (with apologies to legends like Eminem or Nas, who were relatively quiet this year), many of the highly regarded albums in the world of popular rap were filled with syrupy R&B beats and ridiculous R&B singing in their raps (here's looking at you Fetty Wap).  While there were plenty of rappers with rap albums who actually rap, the most attention still ends up with Drake, whose corny beats, pointless beefs and a collaboration with equally lame rapper Future dominated the news."

                "paragraph": "The biggest surprise of 2015 of course came in August, when Dr. Dre finally released his follow-up to his 2001 album many years ago.  No, it wasn't Detox, but rather, Compton, an album inspired by the N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton.  But while this was a great surprise, most of the headlines revolved around the incredibly lame beef between Drake and Meek Mill.  Gone are the days of rappers actually rapping their verses, now we're forced to hear stupid twitter rants and uninspired battle raps.  Clearly the whole thing was a publicity stunt by Meek Mill to promote his album.  Too bad Meek Mill has never been much of a lyricist.  But I digress."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "My favorite hip-hop moment of the year came from perhaps the oddest thing ever to happen to hip-hop.  Run the Jewels, once the most unlikely group, now the best group out right now, released their remix album 'Meow the Jewels,' an odd yet entertaining remix of their Run the Jewels 2 album, featuring nothing but cat sounds.  What started off as a joke became a reality thanks to the plethora of producers interested in making it, and the ensuing fan funded drive to release the album (all proceeds went to charity).  Where else can you find Snoop Dogg singing the Meow Mix song on an album so humorously or Just Blaze acting hysterically over a cat invasion but Meow the Jewels."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Though many popular rappers on the radio suck and can't make a good song, there is hope for hip-hop.  One rapper I discovered this year that impressed me is Mick Jenkins, a young rapper out of Chicago whose mixtape The Water[s] (released last year) was well done and thought out.  A better example of Chance the Rapper (who also comes from the same collective of new rappers from Chicago), Mick Jenkins jazzy production and lyrics about water impressed me.  With lyrics like 'Water more important than the gold / People for the gold / Everybody do it for the gold / People save your souls,' Mick cleverly uses water as a metaphor, which he does throughout the project.  He also released Wave[s] this year, a follow up with similar themes, jazzy production and lyrical talents."

                "paragraph": "Another rapper I discovered is the young musician Raury, who blends all kinds of music, from rap, rock, folk, soul, etc.  I first heard him featured on the excellent Joey Bada$$ song Escape 120, but later listened to his debut project 'Indigo Child,' which finds Raury all over the place, somewhat similar to Andre 3000.  God's Whisper was easily one of my favorite tracks of the year, and the sequel Devil's Whisper (off his recently released debut All We Need, which I haven't fully checked out yet) is just as impressive."

One way I can tell is through XXL's Freshmen Edition, a list of 10 or so rappers they believe are going to be the 'next hot thing.'  The list has degraded in quality since 2010, and this year's list was mostly awful: Vince Staples, Goldlink, Raury, Dej Loaf, Fetty Wap, K Camp, Shy Glizzy, Tink, OG Maco and 'The Peoples Champ', Kidd Kidd.  Here's my opinion on each"

The aforementioned Devil's Whisper showcased a great and unique style from the young Raury.  Macklemore & Ryan Lewis made their comeback with the somewhat clever/somewhat corny song Downtown, featuring old school rappers Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee and Grandmaster Caz, in a song showcasing various old styles of music.  Even Snoop Dogg found a quality song with a funk throwback Peaches & Cream (who needs that reggae shit)."

                "paragraph": "1. Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly: In a time where most rappers make crappy songs to get on the radio with little effort in their music and meaning, one rapper, Kendrick Lamar, excels amongst the other newcomers with his lyrical jaunts, unique production and capturing the raw emotions of all things Kendrick Lamar.  Tasked with outdoing the incredible Good Kid, M.a.a.d. City, Kendrick Lamar continues to show how to make quality music and get the deserved attention without obvious radio play.  With perhaps the best song of the year, the intense 'The Blacker the Berry,' Kendrick raps about the hypocrisy of gang violence, declaring himself 'I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015' which he concludes by rapping 'So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? / When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? / Hypocrite!'.  Featuring a more funk-based version of Kendrick's jazzy stylings, Kendrick not only puts out songs with great beats, but those with thoughtful lyrics, including the inspiring 'Alright' where he proclaims 'we gon be alright' and 'Alls my life I has to fight, nigga,' a song has since been nominated for 'Song of the Year' at the Grammys, along with the funky 'King Kunta,' psychedlic and sexually-charged 'These Walls,' and of course, the popular i, remixed for the album with a slightly different beat, drawing more attention to the song's message (and acapella at the end to Oprah). Kendrick Lamar proves again why he is the best rapper out right now."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "2. Dr. Dre - Compton: Undoubtedly the surprise album of the year, coming completely out of nowhere and off guard, Dr. Dre proves that he still has the musical genius in him to craft a great album, even when so much has changed over the years.  Dr. Dre perfectly blends the classic sound with an updated twist on the magnificent 'Genocide' and 'Darkside/Gone.' With guest appearances from his talented group of rappers over the years, from Snoop Dogg to Eminem (Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit / Whoever I hurt or whatever bridged I burned /In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like / They didn't deserve what I did / And whatever consequences with every verse, it's worth it / So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?) to Kendrick Lamar (Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)/ I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)/ That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody/Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me), along with newcomers like Jon Connor(I told my city 'Hold me down', now look how high they hold me up / I'm Kobe clutch, I hold my nuts 'fore I was old enough to cuss), Dr. Dre provides a fitting end to his rap career."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "3. Joey Bada$$ - B4.Da.$$: The debut album for the young and talented Joey Bada$$ features him in his comfort zone; boom-bap east coast based production nostalgic of the great underground New York sound of the late 90's.  Joey, appreciative of the classic sound, hooks up with legends like DJ Premier, along with new legends like Statik Selektah in creating an album fitting of the era, yet with his lyrical prowess and themes fitting for himself.  A step up from his previous works though not perfect by any means, Joey Bada$$ showcases his style of music via the Scenario inspired 'No. 99,' the touching 'On & On,' and the experimental 'Escape 120' featuring up-and-comer Raury.  At age 20, Joey Bada$$ is clever enough to draw attention (via his cleverly titled album, 'Before Da Money, or another way to spell his own name), yet like many of the greats, Joey has bright years to come to reach the full potential, with lyrics such as 'Cause every time I make a move they be sweatin' me / They want another black man in penitentiary / It's even hard for that man standing next to me / Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me' showcasing his awareness of police brutality in the ghetto."

                "paragraph": "4. Action Bronson - Mr. Wonderful: The ever colorful rapper Action Bronson, with sick and crazy lyrics and a penchant for just having fun on his songs, releases his studio debut, Mr. Wonderful.  A departure from his rugged East Coast raps, Action Bronson goes all over the place with Mr. Wonderful.  Though it features traditional raps with 'Easy Rider' and 'Actin Crazy,' Bronsolino also flexes his experimental side with the bluesy vocals of 'City Boy Blues' and the Chance the Rapper featured 'Baby Blue.'  Action Bronson provides a fun-filled album while maintaining his lyrical prowess, where you will be impressed with lyrics such as 'There were times I used to hide my feelings / Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini / And motherfuckers can't see me / Wait 'till the chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy' but yet will sing along joyfully to 'I got a brand new car / I got a jazz guitar'."

                "paragraph": "5. Mac Miller - GO:OD AM: Mac Miller, fresh off a roller-coaster ride that led him on a crazy drug binge and subsequently in rehab, released his most mature album yet with GO:OD AM.  Featuring Mac Miller having a more mature perspective on his crazy drug songs, Mac Miller releases his most honest work yet.  With tracks like 'Break the Law' and 'In the Bag,' Mac Miller shows he can still have fun on the record, but also shows his depth on the excellent two parter Perfect Circle/God Speed, which sees Mac Miller broken down and built back up with his spiraling drug use, with lyrics on Perfect Circle including, 'Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday/Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway/Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase,' while on God Speed he raps 'Them pills that I'm popping, I need to man up / It's a problem, I need a wake up / Before one morning I don't wake up' showing the redemption of his drug abuse."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "6. Yelawolf - Love Story: After releasing his disappointing debut Radioactive late in 2011, Yelawolf follows it up with a much more honest and fitting follow-up, the ironically titled Love Story.  Tapping into his southern roots, Yelawolf releases a surprising cohesive album, blending southern rock, country and even bluegrass while rapping about the pain and suffering he's experienced since his debut album, with lyrics of struggles including 'Daddy I've been thinkin' about you lately / Mama's never here and step daddy hates me / He drinks a lot, it makes him so mean / Mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams.'  With Eminem as his only guest feature on the excellent 'Best Friend,' Yelawolf also finds his groove on the country inspired 'Till It's Gone,' the funkadelic inspired 'Outer Space' or the Johnny Cash inspired track named after him.  Though not for everyone, Yelawolf finally feels comfortable here, and not rapping corny love songs he clearly didn't want to make."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "7. Tech N9ne - Special Effects: Tech N9ne, always unpredictable and crazy, released his newest solo album, Special Effects in May.  As with any Tech N9ne album, Tech shows off a wide variety of styles, from the dark 'Psycho Bitch III' featuring equally the dark and crazy Hopsin with a show-stealing verse, to the party jams like 'Hood Go Crazy,' featuring B.o.B. and 2 Chainz (enough to show that Tech N9ne doesn't go mainstream, mainstream goes Tech) and of course, the highly anticipated 'Speeddm (WWC2)' collaboration with the great Eminem showcasing the speed raps.  Special Effects, in a departure from his other albums, finds Tech N9ne in even more oddball styled songs, whether it's Trap music or EDM, but yet Tech remains his lovely self, covering a variety of topics 'But why you gotta let the bodies dropping at a coffee shop in Aussie (Aussie, Oi Oi Oi) / But around here, loving coco's the bomb / Meanwhile so many people are taken out by the hands of Boko Haram / Aw yeah?!' as well as flexing his ability to flip words 'Just a crone phall, then it's on y'all / Fuck around and get ya dome sawed off a brone stawl / I can't wait to hear ya squeal and holler / How you set trippin' when you got a multi-dillion mollars, nigga'."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "8. BADBADNOTGOOD & Ghostface Killah - Sour Soul: Ghostface Killah, still strong after twenty years of success via the Wu-Tang Clan and many of his excellent solo albums, collaborated with Canadian jazz trio BADBADNOTGOOD to create Sour Soul, a nice relaxing album sure to satisfy Ghostface Killah's longtime fans as well as those who like a more jazzy backdrop.  Though the album is short (and with three tracks out of twelve being instrumentals), Ghostface makes the best of his use, still capable of dropping dope lines 'Dangerous thoughts, mind of a militia / Bottles of the 1-50 poured over twistas / Broken bones and pillars,Staten Island the illest /The biggest land fillers, we creep like caterpillars '.  Featuring a show-stealing verse on 'Six Degrees' from the unpredictable and possibly insane Danny Brown 'What's on the menu? Eat a rapper like butternut squash / Bark on a nigga with the blade out / Run up in your safehouse, how ironic /Knock a ring on a nigga like somebody hit Sonic', along with songs featuring the underrated Elzhi and mysterious DOOM (still waiting for that collabo album), Sour Soul is a nice little project to relax to."

Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment - Surf: The Social Experiment, a hip-hop/jazz/pop quartet fronted by Chance the Rapper, released their debut album Surf in May exclusively on iTunes as a free download.  Though Chance the Rapper is never going to win 'lyricist of the year,' with corny lyrics like 'I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma/You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma' or 'Bit of a pickle, she tuck her tommy/Rugrat, bare skin, fair skin,' nor inspire people with his oddball adlibs, Chance the Rapper does get credit for maintaining a musical vision and not rapping 'for the radio.'  Released for the summertime in mind, Surf is an interesting mix of hip-hop, jazz and pop blended in through the backings of The Social Experiment, with an impressive guest list including J. Cole, Busta Rhymes, B.o.B. and Big Sean.  Standout tracks include the jazzy 'Miracle,' the fun trumpet stylings of 'Slip Slide' and the sweet pop sound of 'Sunday Candy' which you can't help but sing along to."

Many of their fans don't know a whole lot about all the prospects, mostly knowing those they see on TV, i.e. those who play for big time college basketball teams, which is why, when the New York Knicks selected a young Latvian kid named Kristaps Porzingis, they loudly booed the selection."

But Nowitzki does not have as strong of a post game as Porzingis shown.  Many people may forget how poorly Nowitzki played as a rookie, being called a bust, but by year two, Nowitzki starting showing off his skills and has since become the heralded great he is today.

Much like LeBron James or Shaquille O'Neal, Porzingis is a physical specimen, a 'freak of nature' as they call it.  It's difficult to defend a player his size that can shoot three-pointers with some consistency; 33% is much higher than 0% most 7-footers make.  Sometimes, having those unique and difficult to stop physical features is all some players need, even though most don't have them."

Everyone gets attention in New York.  After all, how can anyone forget the two weeks Linsanity brought upon for the Knicks back in 2012.  Now that Jeremy Lin plays for the Charlotte Hornets, does anyone even care anymore?  Not really.  But combined with the fact that the Knicks have played much better than last year (which was awful by all standards) shows that the Knicks have someone who's a winner.  Thirteen wins through mid-December is far far better than seventeen wins in an entire year.  He's already racked up three endorsement deals (something that probably wouldn't happen in, for example, Charlotte) and people always love an underdog, even those who booed him on draft night.  He even gets bonus points for kind of looking like the young version of infamous Rocky IV fighter Ivan Drago.  So while it seems that the Knicks fans, and fans all over the world will root for just about anything that brings attention to their club, only time will remain whether Porzinger Fever is here to stay or just another case of Linsanity."

In fact, many of them don't think we should do anything at all.  That epidemic of course, is gun violence.  So please America, let's have an honest conversation on how to best handle gun violence and stop with the lies upon lies we keep hearing."

No matter what we do, some bad people are going to commit crimes with guns, but that's not an excuse to do nothing but 'send our thoughts and prayers' to those who die by a gun.  Time and time again, congressman complain 'there's nothing we can do about it' and 'nothing would have stopped so and so from committing this horrific crime.'  While this is true, the point of having laws is to try to reduce crime as much as possible.  There is no major law on the book that hasn't been violated.  Murder, rape, robbery, etc.  Just because many people commit these crimes, doesn't mean we shouldn't have them at all on the grounds that 'people will do it regardless of the laws'.  These same congressmen will do anything to shut down Planned Parenthood and make abortion illegal, yet ignore the fact that women who really want an abortion will get one even if illegal.  Clearly these congressmen have an agenda, it's not a matter of believing 'there's nothing we can do to stop gun violence.'"

                "paragraph": "Other congressmen believe in banning assault weapons and other high-powered military styled weapons meant to kill people, not protect themselves.  Is this honestly achievable?  Of course not.  With all the AR-15's, AK-47's and Tech-9's in the world, a better approach is to go after those who shouldn't have them.  There will always be high-powered guns available no matter how hard these congressmen want them not to be, it's best to go after those who shouldn't have them.  Convicted felons love to stockpile on weapons, i.e. gangs, terrorists, psychopaths."

Some people believe more tests somehow infringes on the rights of those who own guns, but yet the majority of responsible gun owners will pass background checks with flying colors, so who are these people trying to protect?  Those who shouldn't have a gun: the felons, mentally ill, terrorists, etc.  Do they really believe that we shouldn't have background checks at all, and just sell guns to whoever walks into a store?  There are plenty of loopholes where people can legally buy guns without background checks, like gun shows, and sales through family members.  What makes a gun show different than a store anyway?  Nothing.  And sure, most people who commit mass shootings pass background checks, but not all have.  And stronger background checks that better detect mental health issues could have prevented them from purchasing guns.  Dylann Roof, who shot and killed nine black members of a church in Charleston, should not have been legally allowed to purchase guns despite awaiting trial for drug and trespassing laws. John Russell Rouser, who shot and killed two people and wounded nine in a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana before killing himself despite past legal troubles and documented mental health issues."

But while this sounds like a good idea, it's unrealistic and ineffective at curbing gun violence.  For many who live in these cities, a quick drive to the next town, county or state over will bring a plethora of guns.  There are certainly no restrictions on buying guns in a different town than the one you live.  For this to work, it's either all or nothing, and with honest and responsible people owning guns within their rights, they have the right to buy a gun of their choosing."

Murderers like Adam Lanza, James Holmes and Seung-Hui Cho all had documented mental health concerns, yet were able to get a hold of lots of guns.  Yet the very people who claim we need to increase access to mental health treatment are the same people who want to make it more difficult to get access to the insurance they need to seek such care.  Heck, many of our mental health facilities were closed down in the 1980's by Ronald Reagan.  How has that helped our mental health situation?  And each time I hear someone talk about it, they offer no ideas to implement this, instead blaming it all on Obamacare."

For Adam Lanza and Chris Harper-Mercer, their mother's were both gun fanatics who encouraged their sons to become immersed in guns, even buying them guns as presents.  Even worse, both of the parents were fully aware that their kids faced some sort of mental illness.  Classic examples of parents not thinking that their mental illness could lead their children to have violent tendencies.  And why is this?  Because these people see guns merely as used for protection and sport.  They never think their kid would use them to kill, but mental illness leads to irrational thoughts which could be violent."

Organizations like the NRA simply put money and power over the voices and lives of American people.  The NRA will do anything to remain in power, and make record profits, and do so by lying to the public.  They scare gun owners by telling them every expanded background check, restriction and change of any kind is all about keeping guns out of their hands; that the government wants to make a National Registry so they can start taking away guns from innocent people.  Yet none of this is true, even when congressmen come up with bills that explicitly state 'We're not asking for a National Registry,' the anti-government gun fanatics won't believe it.  The NRA refuses to allow any changes at all, even closing loopholes that allow terrorists on 'No Fly Lists' to buy guns. And yet for all their claims that they care about safety and want to make things better, it never happens.  All they say is 'the laws we already have are fine and we need to enforce them better.'  Obviously, the only people the NRA are really fighting for is terrorists and felons, since they're the only ones affected by the background checks they claim is an infringement on your rights."

They suggest more guns, more guns, more guns will stop the violence.  But it never does.  Unless you spend your whole life waiting for someone to shoot you, the shooter will always be more prepared to carry out an attack and have much more arsenal than a person protecting themselves with a handgun.  Anyone with common sense should know that a handgun is nowhere as powerful as high-powered military styled weapons and suicide bombs.  It's no coincidence that every time a major mass shooting is reported, gun sales spike dramatically and the NRA scares people into thinking 'everyone needs more guns'."

Easy access to guns, people who believe everyone should be required to own a gun, an obsession with violent media, you name it.  Finding a panacea for this will never happen.  Doing nothing will only encourage those to continue committing crimes.  We must find a way to take a common sense approach that satisfies both sides of the spectrum.  It starts with having an honest conversation about guns, mental health and violence."

Others were for my local team that I liked growing up, the Portland Trail Blazers, that of the great Arvydas Sabonis.  I even got a throwback jersey of Dr. J from the Philadelphia 76ers.

But reading articles and whatever I could get my hands on, I became drawn to a kid that came straight out of high school in 1996, a kid named Kobe Bryant.  I don't know why I thought so highly of him as a rookie; he was young, raw and untested for the big game, coming off the bench and hitting airballs on occasion, yet Kobe won the Slam Dunk contest, which was a favorite of mine."

Little did I know when I was 11 that Kobe would become arguably the best player of his generation, which for my definitional purposes is from 1998, when Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls for a second time in 1998, to 2010, when LeBron James joined the Miami Heat (and the last year Kobe and the Lakers won the NBA title)."

Though I was more of a Blazer fan due to their proximity, things began to change when the Lakers acquired Kobe Bryant from a trade in the 1996 NBA Draft from the Charlotte Hornets from Vlade Divac (whom was expendable as the Lakers signed Shaquille O'Neal to a monster deal that summer).  During the first two years of Kobe's career, I found myself more and more torn over who to root for.  On the one hand, the Blazers will still my local team, but the great lovable players of the era, i.e. Clyde Drexler, Jerome Kersey and Terry Porter were replaced with talented but malcontent players, i.e. Damon Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace and the worst of them all, Isaiah Rider."

That might fit my Uncle Mike, the San Francisco 49ers/Seattle Seahawks fan, but not for me.  By the time I was fourteen, I knew I had to root for one team, and toss aside the other.

I was surprised when he shaved it off, and began to look like Michael Jordan, but I outgrew that and can't imagine Kobe without the shaved head.  Talent wise, Kobe became an elite player thanks to Phil Jackson."

Centered around Shaq, but also getting a lot of production of Kobe, the Lakers won the first of three championships in 2000.  To this day, I can't think of a better NBA moment than in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and the Blazers, when Kobe threw up the alley-oop to Shaq to ice a fifteen-point deficit in the fourth quarter.  Though many knew Shaq was the best player on the team, an unstoppable force of size and strength, people like me knew that Kobe's efforts weren't for lost, and that Shaq needed Kobe just as much as Kobe needed Shaq."

And that continued into 2002, when the Lakers won their third straight Championship, needing every bit of Kobe to get past the Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference Finals.  But despite having the talented duo of Shaq and Kobe, it would not last forever."

Kobe also faced sexual-assault charges in the summer 2003 from an encounter in Eagle, Colorado.  I was upset having heard the charges, but yet believed the allegations were not true having heard more details.  I don't know what happened that night, but one thing I do know looking back, is that Kobe learned from his mistake and never faced any additional troubles.  By 2004, after the Lakers lost the NBA Finals to Detroit despite adding legends like Karl Malone and Gary Payton, things were about to change for Kobe."

It was sad to see Shaq go, but being a fan of Kobe, I began disliking Shaq and all the negative comments he would make about Kobe to the public.  Sure, Kobe made his comments behind closed doors, but with Shaq's outgoing personality, it seemed overkill on his part.  It took a few years but I eventually forgave Shaq, but at the time, it was all Kobe for me."

Players like Shane Battier and Bruce Bowen, amongst the best defenders to take on Kobe, would defend him perfectly, but yet Kobe was still capable of draining a jump shot with them in his face.  And how could I forget the infamous 'Kobe Stopper' Ruben Patterson, and how Kobe got him to stop using such a ridiculous nickname after Kobe made some nearly impossible shots against him.  But during his prime, Kobe had to take care of things himself, as the perfectionist and willing to win at all costs Kobe would do.  One particular night, January 29, 2006, stands out for Kobe, as he did the unthinkable and scored 81 points.  The game wasn't on TV, but seeing all the highlights left me in awe.  There were plenty of scoring outbursts for Kobe, including one game against Dallas where he outscored them 62-61 through three quarters in a game, but the 81-point game was special, as only Wilt Chamberlin's famous 100 point game ranks higher."

It was difficult to get used to at first, but now I see Kobe as both 8 and 24. Tired of losing, Kobe demanded out of LA.  Unable to win consistently and often paired with unreliable players, i.e. Smush Parker, Kobe showed his mean side and began complaining about the Lakers and trying his best to get out, targeting the young and untested Andrew Bynum as trade bait.  It certainly showed Kobe's unlikability, but yet I understood his frustrations.  I openly pondered whether I would root for the Lakers or follow Kobe to Chicago or wherever he wound up.  I had no problem tossing Shaq aside, but Kobe was different.  Thankfully, I never had to make that decision, as midway through the 2008 season, the Lakers got the sidekick Kobe desperately needed, the talented forward of the Memphis Grizzlies, Pau Gasol.  The two would hit if off and push the Lakers to title contenders once again."

Gone were the complaints to the media about being traded, no more criticism of Phil Jackson, whom molded Kobe to be the great player he was.  In a way, it made Kobe more likable to me, because at times Kobe was immature, like any young player.  And through all in all, Kobe fought every step of the way to contribute, sacrificing his health to win now.  Thanks to Pau Gasol and others, the Lakers won NBA titles in 2008 and 2010.  They lost the Finals in 2009 to Boston but got their revenge, beating out their longtime rivals in one of the most hard thought series ever played.  Haters want to criticize Kobe for winning the Finals MVP that year, but that was such a defensive struggle that no one really deserved it, but they had to give it to someone.  Game 7 struggles don't mean anything."

Once again, the Lakers shook things up, acquiring Dwight Howard and Steve Nash in separate deals.  Neither of these deals worked out, as Kobe butted heads with Dwight Howard, who couldn't handle Kobe's passion to win and hard work to do so, while Steve Nash couldn't stay healthy.  Even more puzzling was the Lakers decision to hire Mike D'Antoni as head coach, over Phil Jackson, who was interested in coming back a third time.  It was at the end of the 2012 season when Kobe started to show cracks in the armor, when he tore his achilles towards to end of the season.  Unfortunately, Kobe's career was never the same, as he couldn't stay healthy and his body started breaking down."

Did he want to 'just have fun' like Dwight Howard?  Not even remotely possible.  Nor did he try to form a Big Three thinking it was make for easier titles like LeBron?  Try again.  No longer can Kobe hit the shots.  Gone are the days of Kobe dunking with power and athleticism.  It's sad that Kobe will retire, but his body won't get younger anytime soon.  He's played in the NBA for 20 years, racking up numerous awards, honors and titles.  Plenty of people hate him for his personality, his determination, or off-putting attitude, but yet they all know Kobe was one of the greatest in his era.  It's unfortunate it had to end like this, and quite sad how poorly Kobe's playing.  But now's the time to take the farewell tour, bask in the glory and honor a great career.

Klay Thompson, the shooting guard, serves as the perfect complement, able to shoot just as well, but with defensive capabilities as well.  Harrison Barnes is capable of putting up points at any given time.  The key difference to the team is perhaps, Draymond Green, the power forward who can not only pound it and get rebounds, but also shoots three pointers with some efficiency.

Also apparent is the Warriors excellent drafting.  Curry, Thompson, and Barnes were all lottery picks, and Draymond Green was a pure touch of gold as a second round selection.  The only free agent splash they made was Iguadola, who sacrificed everything by coming off the bench and reaping all the benefits of winning a Championship (and being Finals MVP, nonetheless)."

Make some great draft picks, which can be difficult since the draft is a crap shoot (after all, who knew Kristaps Porzingis would make a good impact for the NY Knicks).  Get high draft picks, since the Lakers need a top three pick to keep it this year (apparently, LSU has a freshman named Ben Simmons who's supposed to be the next big thing, we'll see).  And finally, take your lumps, especially the young players, because it will be a while for the Lakers can become successful again.  So as its 45-28 Warriors, I'll say adieu for tonight, comment on how ridiculously complex the back of their jerseys are (I like the front, quite classy, but the cable car backs seem like overkill, though I would prefer their old school Run-TMC era jerseys) and suggest that my Grandpa and step-Grandma always seem more excited to see Klay Thompson than me (so he used to live down the street, I met him once as a kid, whoopee, but Mychal Thompson was an all-time great at the University of Minnesota, so there's that).

                "paragraph": "Next year, the United States will elect a new president to lead our country.  We have many candidates to choose from.  Unfortunately, politics, campaigns and spending bring out lots of ugly, negative comments, childish bickering and aiming for the lowest common denominator attempts to attract voters.  Not surprisingly, one candidate stands out in this department, a man obsessed with himself, always trying to gain attention by any means necessary, and a firm believer of 'no news is bad new,'  That man of course, is a man famous for building a rich empire and starring in reality TV shows, Donald Trump."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Throughout the summer and into the fall, Donald Trump has consistently said outrageous, negative, racist, slanderous and incredibly false statements.  Firing off many ridiculous statements gets the attention he craves, yet many in the media ask all the wrong questions.  At a rally in Birmingham, Alabama, Donald Trump proudly proclaimed that 'he saw thousands of Arab-Americans in Jersey City, New Jersey cheering after 9/11.'  Many pundits, truth-seekers and commentators have taken the opportunity to argue that Donald Trump's statements are bogus and no one has backed up this claim.  Yet they ignore the obvious.  Why does that even matter at all?  Trump knows this will do nothing to help with National Security.  Talking about the past does nothing to help the future."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "The real reason Donald Trump makes comments like this?  To rile up his Anti-Islam voters who want to wage war against all of Islam, of course.  There's no substance in what Trump's saying.  There's no truth in what Trump's saying.  And he knows what he's saying is bullshit.  Trump manipulates his voters by reaching into their hatefulness and gives them a false sense of belief that Trump agrees that Muslims are all 'potential terrorists.'  He spews off 'ideas' that Anti-Islamic voters might like, for example, keeping a database of all Muslims living in the United States, but Trump knows this is unconstitutional, racist and Nazi-inspiring.  Trump is not that stupid, after all, he spent years turning a rich empire to an even more rich empire.  Trump makes these remarks to get attention from his hate-filled voters by getting them to believe that 'Trump cares' or 'Trump can get this done,' despite the fact that Trump can't do much of anything by himself as President of the United States."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Donald Trump has mastered the art of capturing people's negative emotions at the expense of rational thought.  It's what makes us watch shows like 'Keeping Us With The Kardashians' rather than the news.  As long as Donald Trump says something that captures a person's negative emotions about a group they don't like (e.g. African Americans), they won't care about actual facts if presented to them as false.  Recently, Donald Trump re-tweeted an image claiming that African Americans commit almost all gun-related crimes in the United States, suggesting data from the Crime Statistics Bureau of San Francisco.  This will appeal to racist, uneducated voters, who have no issue citing 'black-on-black' crime but thinks nothing of 'white-on-white' crime.  Yet an educated person would take the time to research this and realize that the Crime Statistics Bureau doesn't exist, and further realize the data doesn't match up at all.  None of this matters to the racist voter, and Donald Trump hooks them in by claiming 'he understands.'"
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Often times, people who are passionate about their political candidate will trust their choice on their issues.  Donald Trump understands this and makes multiple promises that people believe he will achieve.  All politicians promise things they can't achieve, yet Donald Trump takes it a step further by slamming groups of people into the ground while claiming they 'love him' and that he will win their vote.  It's difficult to win the African-American vote when you encourage your voting bloc to 'beat up' Black protesters who protest at your event.  Same with Hispanics, whom Donald Trump has referred to as 'rapists, killers and drug dealers.'  Donald Trump has also made numerous sexist remarks about women yet he claims he'll win the woman vote.  A rational person would question this, as Donald Trump continues to divide voters with negative racist remarks, but gives his voters the impression he's going to win, and has already won."
            }, {
                "paragraph": "Donald Trump has treated his campaign like he would with his TV work.  He acts outrageous to gain his viewers (in the political world, his voters), mocks his enemies (getting the attention from the media he desperately needs to be relevant) and gets enough people talking about him so he can try to convince them he's the right guy to choose.  Manipulating your way to the top might work on 'Survivor,' but this is the real-world, and in the world of politics, at some point, Donald Trump is going to have to offer some credible ideas and make an actual attempt to gain votes from the people he considers 'rapists, killers, drug dealers, terrorists, stupid and unattractive'.  As someone who was a registered Democrat during the entire George W. Bush administration, it is difficult to believe he actually believes a word he says, because in reality, he doesn't.  He simply manipulates people into believing he does, no matter how rational the truth really is and how far apart it differs from Donald Trump's 'vision'.  Truth be told, Donald Trump, who's threatened to leave the Republican Party numerous times to run as an Independent, probably self-identifies as a member of the Donald Trump Party, one he's exclusive to and which he's the only member of.  Because in the end, Donald Trump is a fraud who only cares about one person, himself."

But for me, I consider myself the unofficial President of the 'I Hate USC' Club, perhaps just the President of the Portland Chapter of the 'I Hate USC' Club.  It shouldn't have to be this way, but yet I passionately hate USC more than any football program in college sports.  Not schools like Oregon State and Washington, nor schools like Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan, rival schools of Oregon (where I started) and Minnesota (where I graduated).  But yet, it's USC that makes me puke the most.  With apologies to my Uncle Fred and cousin Kimmy, two USC graduates who actually show me love and respect (even from afar), here's a time-line of my hatred for USC."

Their football team was irrelevant through the 1990's, with the John Robinson and Paul Hackett eras bringing nothing to the table.  Then in 2001, came along a coach no one initially thought would bring anything to the table, Pete Carroll.  After all, a mediocre NFL coach beforehand couldn't possible do much, right?  Wrong.  USC rose to the top under his leadership.  Not surprisingly, when your team does well, its fans become more rabid and arrogant."

USC fight song doorbell?  The whole thing became sickening.  And throughout this time, my Uncle Hooter always took the opportunity to bash me for going to the University of Oregon.  Never one to show respect, I might have let it slide if not for two things.  First, USC ruled the conference and acted as if they were alone at the top.  It was always 'USC and the Nine Dwarfs.'  Enough to make the remaining members of the conference sick of USC.  Two, I was always reminded of this by Hooter's constant wearing of all things USC colors.  My other Uncle gave me a hard time too because he was an Oregon State grad, but yet he didn't make everything about the Beavers, nor did he always wear Beaver colors."

Have mythically won two straight National Championships, the build-up to the game was ridiculous.  Sports networks like ESPN had already crowned them the National Champion, comparing them to previous title winners over the years.  There was one problem with that though, USC hadn't yet played the game.  Enter Vince Young, the dazzling Texas Quarterback who almost single-handedly beat the USC Trojans and dethroned them.  I guess USC wasn't nearly as good as those all time greats, because they won national championships, USC did not.  Between 2006 and 2009, USC continued to show their arrogance and perceived entitlement, often playing down their opponents.  USC didn't make it back to the National Championship during any of those years, as one Pac-10 team would beat USC in a game USC would have won if they had actually taken them seriously.  This was best exemplified in 2007, when USC, a 42 point favorite against Stanford, lost at the last minute, all the while Stanford, the worst team in the conference at the time, was down to its backup quarterback.  Yet Uncle Hooter would still assume his precious team was the best and downplayed every accomplish every other team had, ignoring the obvious."

And in typical USC arrogance, the school refused to cooperate with the NCAA once they found out.  Obviously, USC knew of what Bush was doing (how couldn't they?) and wanted it to go away.  It eventually grew to their basketball team.  It took years to come to a ruling, but in 2010 USC became the first team to forfeit a National Championship.  Reggie Bush became the first player ever to forfeit a Heisman Trophy, and multiple sanctions were handed down.  Coincidentally (though most people don't think it was), Pete Carroll went back to the NFL, becoming the coach of the Seattle Seahawks."

Gone were the days of celebrating their recent success of their oldest rival, Notre Dame, which I learned as I bought a Notre Dame shirt and wore it to Rosh Hashanah just to piss him off.  No more days of encouraging his kids to stop trying to beat me at video games, turning off the game because they were losing and celebrating their current success of the time.  It was the only way for Uncle Hooter to stay ahead, as Oregon became the top team in the Conference, not to mention more nationally relevant and popular than USC."

                "paragraph": "Their football team was much of the same.  They relied on the past with hopes it would help their present and future.  This was accomplished by hiring Pete Carroll's former assistants to coach the team.  First came Lane Kiffin, who briefly coached the Oakland Raiders, before being fired publicly by then-Owner Al Davis, before coaching the Tennessee Volunteers for one year, racking up more NCAA violations than wins.  Lane Kiffin, a bumbling idiot who considered minor violations a great recruiting tool, had limited scholarships due to their probation and was Bowl-ineligible for his first two seasons.  They got lucky in 2011 to beat Oregon, the top team in the conference.  Sadly, this was one of the biggest highlights of the Hooter's year, as they would criticize Oregon for every loss they got (obviously because they had nothing to be proud of for their team while they were bowl ineligible)."

This was true in 2012, when USC began the season ranked #1.  USC finished that year 7-6, free falling to become the worst Preseason #1 ranked team ever.  By the time the Sun Bowl came, USC clearly didn't want any part of the game, losing to Georgia Tech 21-7, a team that needed a waiver just to play in the game.  The most shocking thing was the Lane Kiffin kept his job until midway through the following season.  Their next coach they hired: another former Pete Carroll assistant, Steve Sarkisian, who brought the Washington Huskies out of the ashes of a 6-6 team to the great levels of a 7-5 team.  Though Steve Sarkisian appeared to be an upgrade from Lane Kiffin, hard to believe he was even worse, and lasted even less."

Despite this, USC was again ranked as the best team in the conference entering this current season.  Not surprisingly USC was over-ranked and looked unimpressive to start the season.  Meanwhile, Steve Sarkisian's life was spiraling out of control, with an alcohol addiction taking control of his life.  Sarkisian was fired midway through the season, after appearing drunk at a meeting.  USC did the right thing by making him go to rehab, but screwed that up by firing him the next day."

But as I celebrated my birthday at the Grand Canyon, my Uncle Hooter, whom I don't talk to anymore, couldn't say anything nice to me or acknowledge my birthday.  Instead, all he could do was mock me for my Oregon hat, with the only argument being that Oregon lost the national championship game.  Typical arrogance of a USC fan.  They have nothing to cheer, so they talk down their opponents like Oregon because they have been far more successful as of recent than USC. It's the only reason people like my Uncle Hooter only appreciate the past.  And as I finally gave it to him, reminding him of their cheating, all Uncle Hooter could do was deny it meant anything.  Winning dishonestly is not a good thing, yet USC fans still deny they did anything wrong and believe they were unfairly targeted."

People like my Uncle Hooter, whom I have no relationship with, always have an inflated ego when it comes to their teams.  They look down at teams like Minnesota (suggesting that any win they get is against subpar opponents).  They believe their team can beat anyone (even though they lost multiple games in a year, that's why Oregon made the National Championship in 2010, they won all their regular season games).  They'll flaunt their legacy (here's looking at you O.J. Simpson, oh wait, his claim to fame was the 'Trial of the Century,' who cares about his football or acting career) and their celebrity fans (Will 'Why does anyone think I'm funny anymore' Ferrell, or Snoop 'My son's a UCLA Bruin' Dogg come to mind).  They love their past, because their present is bad now (I graduated at Minnesota, who has won seven National Championship, but hasn't won a conference title since 1967, doesn't really help now).  There's a reason USC is suddenly setting single game records for most points given up, most yards given up, most touchdown passes given (the latter just set today by Vernon Adams with a 6 touchdown performance).  And it's not because USC is elite."

Enjoy wishing it was still 2004 USC fans, because the game has gotten faster and USC has gotten slower.  And without the ability to cheat up their sleeves, USC is stuck looking at second place.  There's a reason Steve Sarkisian complained about Oregon jerseys.  There's also a reason of persistent and unrealistic rumors of Chip Kelly taking over the team.  Because the time is now and USC is stuck in reverse."

While I don't necessarily agree with these views, it's not a reason to be prejudiced back at them.  Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and it doesn't give one a reason to lump them by race or religion.  I don't take offense against Muslims because some of them aren't Anti-Semitic.  Nor do I hold any hard feelings against people uncomfortable with other races.   As a young person, I did not like to talk about my Jewish faith because I felt like a minority.  I once refused to get a picture with A.C. Green at a camp of his I went to because of he was really Christian and I felt I would be excluded if they knew I was Jewish.

In fact, ISIS, an organization of Sunni Muslims, has attacked and killed many other Muslims; Shiite, Kurds, you name it.  So obviously a black and white world view doesn't work, because if it was purely religious, Muslims wouldn't be the targets of ISIS.  Furthermore, Ted Cruz believes that being Muslim is somehow the cornerstone of all terrorism, and keeping all of them out is the only way safe.  Again, xenophobes view the world in black and white, yet many terrorist groups in the world are not Muslim at all.  Depending on your definition of terrorism, anyone can be a potential terrorist.  People like Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski (a.k.a. the Unabomber) are terrorists for what they did.  Would Ted Cruz call these white people terrorists?  Not likely.  Ted Cruz sees Christians as good, and Muslims as bad.  It doesn't get any plainer than that.

By doing so, you will have a better understanding of how others think, live your life without hysteria and fear of a particular group and generally have less to worry about.  Or, if you are unwilling to get past your xenophobia, you will live your life angry and disgusted, striving for unrealistic goals of so-called purity, targeting groups for no reason other than your perceived negative stereotypes, and misplacing your trust in those who wish to cause you harm but have more in common with you than your perceived enemies.  We can never tell for sure who our friends are, and we definitely can't be sure who our enemies are.  So please, stop living your life in fear and judge them solely by their personality.

But despite the loss of Kill, the program made leaps and bounds in terms of success, fan appreciation and continuity while he was there.  Fanfare was much higher than it was when I went there in 2006, with JerrySota becoming a common phrase for Gopher fans.  They had two choices: Keep things the way it was and retain trusty defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys as its coach, or go in a different direction.  Choosing continuity over uncertainty, Minnesota made the right choice to keep Claeys as Head Coach."

Much like Minnesota, Oregon has kept virtually the same coaching staff since the legendary Rich Brooks became the coach in 1977.  When he took over, Oregon was just another program.  No tradition, no success, not like it is today.  But he built the program from the ground up, and finally, in 1994, after years of gently scratching the surface, Oregon won its first conference title outright in 100 years and made the Rose Bowl for only the second time in 100 years.  During that time, Rich Brooks kept the same coordinators and assistants around, many of whom are still there today.  It was in this factor that Rich Brooks laid a foundation for years to come.  The same foundation Jerry Kill had in all of his coaching stops.  He didn't stay in one place too long, but yet he kept the same staff everywhere he went, with the same results (winning more than before)."

After the Rose Bowl in 1995, Rich Brooks became a coaching commodity and left for the NFL, where the coached the St. Louis Rams for two seasons.  While he wasn't successful in the NFL, Oregon's success was only beginning.  Did Oregon hire an outside sexy candidate to take over?  Nope, they kept it in the family and made offensive coordinator Mike Bellotti the coach.  And Oregon only got better with Bellotti at the helm.  Though Oregon only won two conference titles in the fourteen years there, he became the winningest coach in history, and led the Ducks to twelve bowl appearances, including a breakthrough 2001 season which Oregon finished ranked #2 in the Nation after a convincing Fiesta Bowl win.  And much like Brooks before him, Bellotti liked to keep his assistants in house and kept virtually the same staff.  Bellotti did reach outside to find a new offensive coordinator in 2007, but instead of finding the big name, he went small and found a relatively unknown offensive coordinator at the University of New Hampshire by the name of Chip Kelly, whose potent offense turned Oregon into a National name.  Two years later, Chip Kelly became the head coach after Bellotti retired."

Later, when Chip Kelly left for the NFL, he turned to his offensive coordinator, Mark Helfrich to be the head coach.

Jerry Kill preached this type of tradition, loyalty and continuity by keeping the same staff with him for the twenty one years he coached at various schools.  And who better for Minnesota than Tracy Claeys, who filled in for Kill in 2013 when he took a leave of absence to treat his health problems.  Will Claeys be a great coach?  Only time will tell.  But one thing is for sure, Minnesota is on the right track.  Recruits who wanted to play for Jerry Kill were excited that Claeys would take over, knowing that tradition would stay there.    It's much preferred than what Minnesota previously had.  Tim Brewster, a coach with no prior experience, with three different offensive and defensive coordinators in four years, each with a completely different style that didn't fit the players at all.  Glen Mason, who did little to challenge the Gophers, getting bowl eligible due to cupcake non-conference games while routinely getting beat by the big teams.  This is what happens when you don't have any continuity.  The Gophers don't need the home-run hire.  They're not going to get one.  They don't need the hot coach at the moment.  Remember when the Gophers had the rumors with Al Golden, the hot and upcoming coach at Temple?  How did that one work out for Miami, who hired him in 2011 and fired him last month after a 58-0 loss to Clemson?  That's why Tracy Claeys should be the head coach.

Jenn friends her own childhood friends on Facebook, not to be real friends with them, but to snoop on their pages and see what they're up to.  Sometimes, Jenn friends, unfriends and friends them again, just because she's bored of not knowing what these people are up to."

High school peoples Jenn didn't like, you're not safe from Innocent Online Stalkers like Jenn.  Former co-workers that Jenn didn't like working with?  Don't try to hide, and if you do, watch out.  Jenn's coming for you."

We asked Jenn if she still stalks her.  The answer is no, as Jenn has bigger fish to prey, she told us.  She even got the idiot ex to 'Like' a sarcastic post complimenting him and friending her on LinkedIn, apparently oblivious to the fact that Jenn can't stand the fool."

Her latest target, David Brian Michael, a former friend of a relative wanted out of Washington County for check fraud, identity theft and forgery.  In addition to checking his Facebook every day hoping he'll slip up and reveal his location, Jenn is stalking his family members and friends, hoping someone will say something stupid, from Oregon to Louisiana.  No one's safe from Jenn the Innocent Online Stalker.  According to Jenn, it's important to bring this clown to justice.  So remember, if you've seen or heard from David Brian Michael, call the police and send him to prison.  You can make a difference."

Does the Lakers future look bright?  I'd say yeah, not this year, but a couple years down the road, the Lakers will be contending again."

So unfortunate he's gotten to this point, for all the years of heart and sacrifice he put with the Lakers, and now he's a shell of himself.  But Kobe has an opportunity to develop some young talented players if he can control his shooting tendencies.  Jordan Clarkson looks like a keeper, he's a good shooter and has the heart.  Plus with D'Angelo Russell being drafted, I get the feeling Clarkson has a chip on his shoulder, as he should.  A second-round pick last year who knows by name and order of every point guard taken before him should have plenty of motivation.  As someone who loves that kind of fire, I believe the future is bright for Clarkson.  It's the main reason I wouldn't have taken Russell at the 2nd pick, but we'll see how D'Angelo Russell turns out."

He made some nice passes in last night's game against Denver.  But is he going to be the next LeBron?  Of course not.  Kobe wasn't very good his first year, and he was straight outta high school.  Jordan Clarkson spent three years in college, he's battle tested."

                "paragraph": "As for the other bright young star for the Lakers, Julius Randle, watch out NBA, Randle has some freakish skills.  In a couple years, when he learns everything, he's going to dominate.  With the bruising style of Zach Randolph mixed with Lamar Odom's finesse, Julius Randle is not your ordinary player.  Watching him take the ball down the court is a sight to see.  He's still young, but perhaps the broken leg in his rookie year will help his game in the long run.  Defensively he needs help but other than that, wow."

As you will see on my web page, I have updated my initial version of Bodie Web Design by using Express as a web framework.

Now only is it useful for following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, but it easy to use.  Because in developing, unlike a good Cappuccino, it's good to be dry."

Using the powerful Node.js engine to run a website, it uses many of its functions to keep everything going.  Got many pages to add, just set up a new route to go there.  Want to add Jade?  You can set variables and call them out in your code.  For example, instead of typing in Bodie Web Design millions of times, I dried it up and set a variable equal to it, then called for it in my title tags.  Now I can use with, combine with others, and do whatever I want to it.  Yay!"
